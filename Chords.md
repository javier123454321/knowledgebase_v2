- The Major and Minor scale 
- ## The Perfect Fifth
    - in the A [[Natural Minor]] Scale from A to E there are 7 semitones
    - In the C Major scale also
- ## The Third Degree
    - From C to E there are 4 semitones.  This is a Major third
    - From A to C in the minor scale, we have 3 semitones. This is a Minor third
- ## The Major Triad
    - To create a Major chord, we take the Major Third and the Perfect Fifth together with the tonic.
    - C  E  G to turn that into a Minor chord, drop the third by one semitone. Play the triad with a minor third.
    - So if you take the triad for each degree of the C Major Scale
    - C Major
    - ```
    - C   E   G
        - 4   7        <-semitones
        - Maj Perfect
    - ```
    - D Minor
    - ```
    - D   F   A
        - 3   7        <-semitones
        - Min Perfect
    - ```
    - E Minor
    - ```
    - E   G   B
        - 3   7        <-semitones
        - Min Perfect
    - ```
    - F Maj
    - ```
    - F   A   C
        - 4   7        <-semitones
        - Maj Perfect
    - ```
    - G Major
    - ```
    - G   B   D
        - 4   7        <-semitones
        - Maj Perfect
    - ```
    - A Minor
    - ```
    - A   C   E
        - 3   7        <-semitones
        - Min Perfect
    - ```
    - B Diminished
    - ```
    - B   D   F
        - 3   6        <-semitones
        - Min Diminished
    - ```

    - The 3 Major Chords, C G and F are commonly used together
    - C is the Tonic Chord
    - G is the Dominant
    - F is the Subdominant
