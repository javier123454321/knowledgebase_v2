    - Memory Captures 
        - Negatives
            - Memory captures is not worth so much of time. I am working 8 hours per week on admin + 40 full time work + 10-20 in different jobs for memory captures. Stocking, making fliers, training, being a memoryist, dropping off checks.
            - I don't get enjoyment or pleasure from the menial tasks that are required to run the business. 
            - I don't want to work for another 5 months for what would amount to around 70 hours a week to maybe have a chance at taking a huge paycut.
            - I don't really want to be a manager for Memory Captures.
            - I have no passion for the digital word of mouth advertising industry, don't particularly care for capturing memories either. 
            - The fact that i do get a feeling of being physically tied to Chicago even if it's not entirely accurate. I can travel but I somehow feel bad, and I see the effects of taking a weekend off on the numbers.
        - Positives
            - Gaining experience in running a business
            - Being my own boss
            - Seeing something that I created come to life.
            - Has the potential of helping out kagyus to come to the us to travel and pay for the whole trip
            - Be able to take decisions about what to work on, the experience in the web page, 
            - Developer experience
        - What are the conditions for me to stay?
            - That I don't have to spend over 48 hrs/week on this. I would have to quit [[Keypath]] to achieve this.
            - That
