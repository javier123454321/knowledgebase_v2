        - following up on the fact [[Architecture]] is not as efficient as tech startups at changing the world
            - Architecture, however, when productized into an abstract object looses the situational appeal that appears when designing something perfect for the landscape.
            - Architets usually take the site as the starting point,, and having a product that can adopt to any site would mean having a product that is different for each site. duh
                - This would mean that every piece of architecture would be unique, so you loose every economy of scale that was possible before.
                    -  and is therefore inefficient.
    - a book is not a book, it is a tool for you to enter into the experience of the author through words
        - If you can derive an experiential model of the world (as opposed to a theoretical one) you can arrive at better tools for understanding existence
        - we can easily fall into the trap of obsessing over the tools rather than the problem at hand
        - we want to not only think of a note taking system to be good for note taking, but to be a tool for a purpose. Sometimes we take too much time focusing on the tools that we use and not on the solutions that we are trying to achieve with those tools.
        - An educator's role is to create a condition where the present experience is taken into full advantage, where every aspect of a situation is exploited as a tool for learning, where we maximize the moment in the present, to carry with us this curiosity and disposition towards future experience.

            - thinking that solutions will come from only understanding the problem within the category that you are preconceiving is a faulty premise
            - categories are tools, but we cannot let tools define us
