Abstract:
Summary:
	Proof of stake solves the Byzantine General's problem via a pseudo random selection of who is the validator that should submit the next block.
> 	  The Generals know how quickly each block takes to be created under the PoS consensus algorithm and so after a period of time will be able to know if enough of the other Generals are working on the same chain to be able to make a successful attack

Generals are being chosen randomly. Proof of work on the other hand allows for economies of scale. Large miners create larger rewards.
