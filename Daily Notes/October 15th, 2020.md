        - Summary::
             What is the value proposition of your business? What is the meat
                - Everything else can be systematized and someone else can handle them. You become a supervisor
                    - Never let the business slide though, you need to keep an eye in the 
            1. A good system is customer focused
                - Cannot take away from the experience of our customers
            2. A system has to be world class
                - Beware f the perfoctionist paradox
                    - A system has to be adjustable and there should always be room for improvement. It cannot be perfect by definition
            3. Have a system that takes you to where you are going
                - If the system will be obsolete in 6 moths it might be too fragile
                - If it is meant to last for 10 years, it might be too broad
                - Aim for 2-3 years, then re-evaluate.
            4. Single outcome per system
                - Having a singular focus allows you to measure whether it is doing what it has to do. 
                    - Marketing system to attract middle managers in restaurant chains that have multiple locations and 300 chairs at 80% capacity in Chicago.
            5. Single Ownership per system
                - Someone has to be responsible for the system
                    - Fr checking the system
                    - Making sure that it is being followed
                    - Making sure that the utcomes are as expected
                    - You will be the first person running everything at the beggining
                        - Once we get the latitude and runway to get someone else in that system
                        - **Focus on that which takes the majority of your time but is not crutial to the creation of value in your system**
                            - Support functions - record keeping, processing, shipping and receiving. You should focus on the higher value element.
            6. Make the systems simple and documented
                - Convoluted systems won't be followed
                - It also needs documented. If someone gets sick, then someone else can just follow them.
                    - Someone else should be able to pick the system up and run with it. 
            7. Measured and rewarded
                - Assembly line is a straightforward example.
                - If the system is measureable, it makes it easier to tweak and improve.
                    - It also allows you to see if it is being followed. It allows you to reward people implementing it correcly
            Getting good systems in place is an investment in freedom for the future. It allows you to take a break and follow
            Types of systems to focus on
                - Attraction || Conversion || Delivery || Connecting || Tracking
                    - Attraction
                        - Usually, but not necessarily, marketing
                        - How are you attracting people to come to your business
                    - Conversion
                        - How are you retaining them?
                        - Once people show some interest, how do you follow up
                    - Delivery
                        - How are you fullfilling the process of delivering value for the customers
                        - How is it being implemented
                    - Connection
                        - It takes a group to fullfill all the above. You are always a part of a connected whole
                            - Do you have a way to bring people in, to nurture
                    - Tracking
                        - Track, if you can't measure, you can't manage, you can't improve
                            - data is the necessary evil in business
                            - You have to track it, it is the marker to see if the pulse is there
