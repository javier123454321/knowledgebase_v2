- Abstract::
    - The concept of the book is an attempt to answer the question of why is it that after the fall of the soviet union and its influence in poland, the people that were most able to quickly adapt to the new Liberal Democratic State were the hardcore communists. Logically, if these two systems were so opposed to one another, you would expect a divergence between the two camps, but it tuns out the opposite was true. What is at the root of this?
- Summary::
    - 1. Introduction
        - That there seems to be a disturbing tendency towards [[communism]] in liberal democracy. Whereas this might be taken as a fluke, there might be some more fundamental underlying reason to be the case. If you dig into the roots of [[communism]] and liberal democracy, you find the idea of a modernization underpinning their foundations. Modernization is a one sided path towards a more ideal future, and both of these systems look to be under the assumption that they are at the pinnacle of history.
            - This is EXTREMELY explicit in Marx's theory of the science of dialectical materialism. Marx even points to the inevitability of material forces locked into a constant struggle for dominance in society. Liberal Democracy is not as clear to me from its foundations whether it is the case that there is a certain inevitability to it, but it might be my lack of knowledge in the topic.
        - This drive towards the ultimate state of history leads to a few outcomes, one obvious being that an attack on the foundations of your system means an attack t the idea of perfection. Criticizing [[communism]] or liberal democracy would mean critizising the future prosperity and benefits of this potential and should therefore be stopped. 
            - Totalitarian and absolute concepts are dangerous because of this. [[communism]] is an epitome of this example.
    - 2. History
        - [[communism]] on History
            - Communism has a view of history that posits communism not as a possibility but an inevitability. This concept was hailed by Engels in a speech given at Marx's funeral that says that like Darwin discovered the laws of nature, so had Marx discovered the laws of history. Karl Popper then argued that history did not fall into the purvue of an object of scientific inquiry (based n his falsifyability principle) so this is not only logically faulty, but presented a danger towards totalitarianism and political violence.
            - Te second point is that those that are most aware of the historical road to communism will be the ones that will bring it forward. Of course the proletariat, but also the intellectual class and the students during the revolution
            - The third point is about the very abstract idea that the history and process of humanity was towards full self consciousness as described by German metaphysics
        - Liberalism on History
            - Liberalism does not have a singular point that converges into a person responsible for the ideas espoused within it, but it does have a bent towards liberty and its struggle with authority.
                - Whereas communism spoke about the end of alienation, the recouperation of labor time and leisure within society at the victory of the proletariat over the burgeoise, liberalism's future - when freedoms trumps over authority - was one of a peaceful cooperation between warring countries over fair markets.
                - Liberalism also depended on the growth of the individuals within its structure, a tendency towards enlightened absolutism to achieve its outcome. A self actualization like the one of communism and requires a growth of the individuals to achieve its inevitable conclusion. 
		Conservative and Liberal approaches to historical progress
			[[Ryszard Legutko]] talks about the difference between sort of naivety which a young person might have about history as opposed to an older person who is much less likely to want to throw away the old and start a new.  
			A young person is enchanted by the possibilities and has a naive idea that the world is at a historical moment where a completely new way of doing things can be born. Meanwhile the older person might take an approach saying everything has been done before.  
			Communism and liberalism both share and approach that there is an unbroken line towards progress and therefore have young Person's View.  
			matches a lot with [Jordan Peterson](Jordan%20Peterson.md) thoughts about the danger of just destroying all of the hierarchy that we have developed over millennia.  
			It also similar to the article on [Voluntary Governments](Voluntary%20Governments.md) because we want society to be slow at making progress by design as opposed to throw out all the progress that we've made for experiment that might turn negative. Communism is the greatest example of a failed experiment. So long as stakes are so high, there is no way of accelerating progress without risking too much.

    - Similarly, according to its followers can arise in the wake of liberal democracy, which, per a common though rarely explicitly articulated conviction, exhausted the process of political transformations.  if there is such an ability to hypothesize possible political arrangements, this cannot lead us, in the first case, beyond communism, or in the second, beyond liberal democracy.
