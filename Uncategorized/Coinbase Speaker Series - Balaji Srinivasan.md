Summary::
	[The new digital divide](The%20new%20digital%20divide.md)
	[[Silicon Valley's Ultimate Exit]] - a concept which was denied by media giants. In 2013 Balaji was noticing a trend. Silicon Valley started with the birth of the transistor and a new culture [Difference Between East and West Coast](Difference%20Between%20East%20and%20West%20Coast.md). The old money was definitely going to come down to the spirit of Silicon Valley disrupting everything, and the only chance of survival is to use the tools which we were building to scatter and become less physically centralized. 
		[[Nomadology]] fits into this narrative perfectly, the state apparatus, looking at the nomad science disrupting its smooth space will attack back. However, dealing in arborial terms, it will look at the head while roots can scatter, use striated space, and disperse.
	The difference between the crypto 'industry' is that it is a community movement. Banks do not get thousands of defenders mobilizing when regulations are brought down upon them.
