- [[Networking]] concept that assigns an address to a network object. Every device has an IP address that uniquely identifies it and enables it to communicate with and exchange data with other devices connected to the internet.
- Basic protocol worried about delivering data packets across a network. Works together with [[Transmission Control Protocol]] to ensure data delivery, but IP is only worried about the data transfer and directions. TCP ensures the delivery and communication happened and reconnects if it hasn't.
