        - Our brain will try to justify every action
        - Every social interaction has a social status negotiation
            - Higher status is more open
                - Sets the tone and pace
            - Lower status is more closed
        - Laughter
            - only 20% of laughter has to do with humor
            - Speakers are more likely to laugh than listeners
            - Laughter is a play signal, during play fighting, it indicates that you are still ok
            - Laughter conveys what we are not caring deeply about
        - School
            - School is sold as a place to learn the material
            - Yet most of school work isn't useful, people don't require the knowledge that you learn there for the jobs that need to the degree
            - It is more of an indicator of habits, concientiousness, obedience
        - Medicine
            - Story: Go to a doctor to get well
            - There is not much of a correlation between health and medicine
            - Randomized experiments do not show that people that have access to medicine are healthier
            - Medicine is more important to people than sleep, while the latter is more effective
                - Helping someone while you are sick is a huge loyalty signal.
        - We are aware of the 'social' motives, but there are deeper more selfish services. It gives us a type of plausible deniability when questioned
        - We need social institutions that pretend to give people what they pretend to want, but actually give them what they actually need as well. 
    - Grokked::
        - As humans, we tend to have a conscious explanation of our behavior, without understanding the deeper motivational tug of war which our brain plays. We believe to be rational but are much more emotional, intuitive, and are driven by factors which are beyond the surface.
        - If we want to create something useful or valuable, you need to understand the motivation which is deeper than the surface level, deeper than what people will 'tell' you is their motivation.
