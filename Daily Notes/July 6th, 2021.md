        - Started doing Justin.tv to create a reality tv show about his life
        - Was carrying around a backpack connected to cellphones, (smart phnes weren't a thing)
            - Got people asking to do their own show
            - focused on videogames, turned into twitch
        - Entrepreneurship allows for plenty of choice but focus can become a problem.
        - Choosing B2B vs B2C 
            - When you have nothing going for you, you can focus on market risk

        - Market Risk vs Execution Risk
            - How to know if an idea has a lot of market risk
                - When pivoting justin.tv to twitch, very few people believed that this even existed as a business.
                    - No experienced entrepreneurs were thinking to compete.
                - It's a lottery ticket, so experienced entrepreneurs are more foolish to go into that market.

                        - App that lets you watch others play vidogames
                        - [[Valorize]] should be foolish
            - Execution Risk
                - For something that you have a path forward, knowing the ins and outs of that gives you a much better competitive advantage
        - Fundraising, big vs lean
            - Going big is not necessarily the best strategy to push forward with.
            - Certain markets require the big upfront investment
                - Legal for example, needs companies that will guarantee a certain degree of longevity
            - Fundraising makes sense when it will accelerate the execution of an idea, especially one that is verified. It doesn't make sense if you are still formulating the idea.
        - If there are problems that silicon valley has not solved in certain industries, maybe it's that the techniques that they are trying is inadequate for that problem space
