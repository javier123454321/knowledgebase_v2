Day 3 of polyphasic sleep experiment. Felt overall well. Was pretty tired when first waking up but got into a working zone after an hour. Went out to the buddhist center to meditate, was not fully awake so it was a slow and 'sleepy' meditation. I came back at 7 for my first nap, had the same experience as yesterday where I woke up one minute before the alarm went off at 7:20. Experienced vivid dreams during that nap. 
The other two naps were interesting, for both I felt like I was unable to fall asleep for a few minutes, then I woke up from vivid dreams thinking I overslept. Felt groggy especially after N3

Sleep Cycle
	**Core - 11:00pm - 2:15 am**. Had a zombie period until around 3:30
	**N1 - 7:00pm - 7:19pm** felt super energized upon waking and naturally got up right before my alarm went off. Super vivid dream, that I could not remember.
	**N2 - 12:20pm - 12:40pm** Felt a bit groggy after waking
	**N3 - 5:40pm - 6:00pm** Woke up very groggy, also had a feeling that I had overslept my nap. 

Overall Mood - excited to get to the point where my alertness comes back to normal, feel a bit sleep deprived still overall, with noticeable periods of alertness in between.
