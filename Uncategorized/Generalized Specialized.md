    - On Specialization
        - Specialization is great, it has moved us forward incredibly far. It has also led to amazing incremental discoveries and tools. The problem is when you get hyper specialized, and narrow more and more your domain to the point where it no longer is useful. 
            - "Academia is the place where you become an expert in something so narrow that there are only 3 others who know what you are talking about and you will argue with until you die."
        - I have a firm belief that specialization is best applied in collaboration between disciplines. My hope is to connect specialists and maybe even give a new perspective to someone who has developed a tunnel vision.
