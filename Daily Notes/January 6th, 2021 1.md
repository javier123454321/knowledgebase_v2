        - MMaking a living off of creativity has been a dream for so many for so long. Today we have the low barrier to entry, high barrier to meaningful activity economy in Youtube. The model will likely be hybrid.

        - Hey Jacob, I looked your stuff over, and I honestly would need a little more getting to know your work before recommending you personally. I did want to give you some feedback of why because I know that the process can be grueling and the feedback is scarce.

It seems clear that the work that you have in your [[portfolio]] is from a bootcamp, and while I know they can be great to boost your skills, I have this thought in my mind that I am unsure how much help you got in implementing it. There is also something about the projects, because I know that they are not really meant to be used in reality. There is a difference in terms of software that will be used by people, and software that is just a demo. I'd love to see something that you did outside of the bootcamp, without the structure that it provides. Even a simple dashboard could be nice, not overly complicated, but providing value. Another thing could be contributing to an open source project.

It is a bummer because I know that it is a lot of work that you have put into this, and you are quite likeable.

        - This is absolutely valid, and something that I have considered. On my limited behavioral questionnaires and conversations, I do get the feeling that it is not a problem that people "want" to fix from the consumer behavior side. The marketplace is two sided though, and as far as the creator economy works, I think there are a multitude of 'infulencers' that could benefit from structuring knowledge in this way.

The end goal is to create something like the textbook of the digital age. Something between a course and a book. Books are good but the model of learning that they embody is closer to transference. Courses are good also, but much of the time they are made for following along and repeating the mechanics - which can be effective, but it is not done deliberately. They also tend to miss on the community aspect. Often you are dumped into a forum or a discord server with thousands of others. We know that communities (cohorts) of 15 or less are far more effective in keeping people accountable, yet we go after volume usually in online learning.  

I do like this problem space because I feel quite passionate about e-learning and the potential benefits of it. I also like it because I see the "creator economy" booming right now, and it makes sense to me to be part of those selling shovels in a gold rush. It also would make it so people sell less vaporware and actually provide more value.  

As far as your idea goes, I have a question about what the "thing" actually is? Is it a list of courses that applies to your interests/capabilities, does it get delivered via mail? I would worry about the fact that it is not really a recurring thing, and the churn would be quite high. It actually seems like a good compliment to an already existing course platform.
