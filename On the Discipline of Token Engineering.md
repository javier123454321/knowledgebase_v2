- Token Design and Engineering is a new field, but it is not born in isolation. At it's core it is about designing the initial conditions of a complex system, and playing with those variables to get a desired outcome. In architecture, we call this generative design.
- Frei Otto would design buildings which were based off of an initial parameter, and would allow the forces of surface tension and gravity to define what the shape would be. This is a complex system, where the outcome can be computed from its initial setup but the initial state cannot be derived from its current outcome.
