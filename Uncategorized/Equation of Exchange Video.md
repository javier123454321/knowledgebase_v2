Abstract:

Summary:
	The Equation of Exchange is simply $$MV=PQ$$ where
	 $M = \text{money supply}$
	 $V = \text{Velocity of Money}$
	 $P = \text{Price for a Good}$
	 $Q = \text{Output or number of Txs}$
	**The Classical Model** 
		assumes that supply and demand works, and $Q$ is the best it can be all the time and fixed.
		$V$ assumed to be fixed, actual money is not _held_ 
		so in the classical model, it's like this:
		$$M\overline{V} = P\overline{Q}$$ Which implies that $$(\uparrow M)\overline{V} = (\uparrow P)\overline{Q}$$ The higher the monetary supply, the higher the price of goods. Inflating the money supply is equivalent to inflating prices. 
	**The Classical Model - Friedman's Version**
		$$M\overline{V} = P(Q\uparrow _\text{increases 2\% a year})$$ Friedman argued that the $M$ should increase in price to maintain with the growing $Q$, so the increase in $M$ should be around 2% a year.
	**The Keynesian Model** 
		$Q$ depends on aggregate demand not money supply, and $P$ is static, so an increase in $M$ is met with people just holding money, or reducing the velocity: $$(\uparrow M)(\downarrow V)=\overline{P} \cdot \overline{Q}$$ Basically assumed that increasing monetary supply is innefective. Increase in supply is decrease in velocity.
	**The Modern Keynesian Model**
		Increasing supply might actually encourage businesses to invest, and therefore increase Q.
		$$(\uparrow M) \cdot V=\overline{P} \cdot (Q\uparrow)$$ The Federal Reserve works this way, basically. Tweak the supply to move up the total output.
