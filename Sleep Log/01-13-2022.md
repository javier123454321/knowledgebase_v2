Day 2 of the [[polyphasic sleep]] experiment

Waking up was much harder today than yesterday during my first trial day. I have been awake for an hour now and still feel groggy. I am looking forward to my nap. 

At 3:00 am, I don't feel like doing anything productive, actually felt like a zombie and went straight to the couch to browse TikTok, not a great feeling overall. Might take a few moments of chill before attempting work. 

4:00 am, starting to feel awake. Took around 90 minutes to get here. hoping to get more efficient at sleeping to get to this point faster. I feel like I could not meditate before, but now I feel like I can. Probably won't though, yesterday I did it with the sunrise and it was great. 

9:00 am, feel tired still. Groggy, a bit zombiefied. 
Sleep Cycle
	Core: 11:00 pm to 1:45 am
	N1: 7 - 7:19: I got to sleep and wake up a minute before the alarm. Have no idea how that happened. 
	N2 - 12:20 - 12:40 Was a good experience, felt rested and awake after
	N3 - 5:41 - 6:01 Was feeling awake before jumping into the nap. Then I woke up feeling tired.
