Status: [[In Progress]] 
Abstract:
Summary:
	It is hard to approach [[Capital]] without preconceived ideas. We tend to read it through our disciplinary lens. 
	Three conceptual blocks that are brought together.
		- Political Economy
			- English mostly, deep criticism of Adam Smith, Stewart, Ricardo etc. Might be called deconstruction today - Theories of Surplus Value.
				- You learn to deconstruct arguments and find what is missing that transforms the argument
		- Classical Critical Philosophy
			- The significant influence in Critial tradition in the vein of Hegel, Spinoza, Kant 
		- Utopian Socialist tradition
			- Mostly french, Etienne Cabe, Proudhon, Fourier. A bit frustrated with their works, no process on how to get there. Marx's goal is to convert the utopian project to a scientific project.
			- He wanted to distance himself from this tradition as he saw it as a failure. 
		Marx's project was a combination of the empirical tradition of english political economy, with the german criticism of classic critical philosophy with a utopian impulse.
