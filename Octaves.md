- # Octaves
- Take the major scale for C
- The note that repeats
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
    - 2  2  1  2  2  2  1
    - T  T  S  T  T  T  S
- ```
- Semitones represent the smallest distance between notes.  and the Tone represents 2 semitones.
- A scale with 2 semitones and 5 tones is a d**diatonic** scale
- ## Modes
- If you center the sound around a different note, you get a different mode of the music. This gives a different quality to the sound you play.
