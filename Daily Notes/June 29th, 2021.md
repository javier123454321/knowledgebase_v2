        - Say your idea in one sentence, even if it discards over half of the potential for it
            - if you capture half, you are 50% of the way there

    - [[Edward Snowden]] Conspiracy practices

        - The idea is that speaking about theories of conspiracies distract us away from the actual practices that are taking place, openly.

        - whereby a true conspiracy (e.g. the 9/11 hijackers) triggers a false conspiracy (e.g. 9/11 was an inside job), and a false conspiracy (e.g. Iraq has weapons of mass destruction) triggers a true conspiracy (e.g. the invasion of Iraq).
            - Interesting that he dismisses the 9/11 is an inside job scenario. I see it as the most probable outcome. His point still stands, you can operationalize a lie to create a worse truth.

    - [[Ethereum]] Scaling mechanisms
        - [[State expiry]]
            - An approach for removing chunks of no longer relevant state in the blockchain
            - Given a state period has exired ~ 1 year there is no data written into that anymore instead it goes into a new tree
            - Only the most recent two trees need to be stored by a 'proposer'
            - Only the most recent tree can be written to.
        - [[Weak statelessness]] 
            - only require block proposers to store state, and allow all other nodes to verify blocks statelessly. Implementing this in practice requires a switch to [Verkle trees](https://notes.ethereum.org/@ZuSZK8r2TgO7eFShwj4hVg/H1XE_w30w) to reduce witness sizes.

    - [[Token Economy: How the Web3 reinvents the Internet]]
        - Why do we treat data as tough it is in a silo? The data structures that we have today mostly deal through a client to server, the latter being a centralized entity with exclusive root access to manipulate it. Blockchains create a distributed system which allows ANYONE root access. This means that there is now a settlement layer to the internet itself, beyond a database. A collective information layer to the internet itself has massive implications for so many applications. 
        - Take single sign on, why is google or facebook in charge of your online identity. Well, because they pay for the servers that host the data, you consent to their terms of service, just hope you don't get cancelled. 
        - With encrypted private/public keypairs you don't need that anymore. Now you can submit your identity, pay the network to process and store it, and you have effectively created a decentralized repository for who you are online. No need to let big tech handle that for you, the internet is coming of age.
