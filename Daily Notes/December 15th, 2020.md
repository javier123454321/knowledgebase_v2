        - **The Rules for Making Money** (as a freelance developer)
            - 3 Rules
                - 1. Understand that the money you make is directly proportional to the value to other people
                    - Customers don't care about you, your experience. All that matters is the value
                    - Restaurant
                        - Want to create an app that lets people order
                            - CMS vs Custom Solution
                                - Customer won't pay more for the exact same functionality
                                - 3000 dollars vs 5000 dollars with parity of features
                                - Customer situation is not improved. 
                                - **If we want something custom make customer understand the value of your solutions **
                                    - Limitations of CMS, how valuable is the flexibility
                - 2. Focus on your highest paying activities
                    - Making a simple app that takes 5 hours and you will charge 2,500 vs a 50k app that requires months. 
                        - It is the simple math. if the second app earns you $350 an hour to make, and the first one earned $500, even if the latter was more overall money.
                - 3. Understand you have a full time job and should work according to that
                    - You don't get paid for not going to work. 
                    - You have to spend the time working on the business
        - **Planning Your Business**
            - 1. Funding
                - You need to be profitable from day one
                - **Losing money is not OK**
                    - Recommendation:: [[Profits First]]
                - Avoid Debt to start your business
                    - The business needs to fund itself
                - If you have a full time job, you just got another full time job in Freelance
                - You can't really go broke if you don't owe money
            - 2. Niching
                - Picking a niche is a strategy to make more money, taking anything is a strategy for taking less money
                - Niching is a way to charge more
                - Restaurant example
                    - You have to research restaurants, third party providers.
                    - You can charge more in the future to other restaurants (Or charge the same for work you have already done)
                - Allows to build a scalable business
                    - Taking whatever comes in - learn languages, frameworks, industries.
                        - Second client repeats the learning. Constantly working more for for less money
                    - Saying no when something comes that is outside your niche
                        - [Unsure if I like this]
                            - It makes sense, but it does not necessarily follow why I want to do the things that I want to do. Makes me more likely to dislike the job that I end up creating for myself. It's more profitable to assembly line the thing, but it s not more interesting. My engagement is also crutial for the long term success of the business. 
                - Build a niche to something you are interested in or excited about
            - 3. Defining Services and Payments
                - 1. How much are you interested in the work
                    - Boring/dull work make it likely you wont stick it out
                    - Making it interesting is not enough
                - 2. To what extent is it scaleable
                    - Is there a customer base out there?
                    - Can you do the work that you can reuse?
                - 3. To what extent is it outsourceable
                    - Can you do some of the work if you are a junior
                    - If it can't be outsourceable at all, then it might not be the best thing.
                - Figuring out the pricing
                    - Flat fees and value based models are much better tan hourly rates.
                    - You can charge 3k for a website twice, and the second one is much faster to do
                        - **This is not sneaky** The customer gets more value
                            - Expertise
                            - Resilience
                                - The site has bugs worked out
                - Figure out recurring revenue
                    - Having this takes out the highs and lows and provides flexibility
            - 4. Forming the Company
                - What type of business entity makes sense
                - Not just getting a license but making a company
                - Forming a corporate entity
