- Summary::
    - In computer science we define complexity in space and time to calculate a given algorithm.
        - In applying this to a real world problem, computational approach to complexity is the measure which an algorithm can increase the variables of the system and grow in an efficient way.
            - The search for regularities within a complex system defines the measure, a completely random system has no regularities and is therefore not complex, as is a completely regular system.
                - You find complexity in a region intermediate between total order and complete disorder - [[Murray Gell-Mann]]
