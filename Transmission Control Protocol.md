    - It is a protocol that opens communications between client and server and ensures the connection remains open until it is no longer needed. 
    - It breaks down packets to manageable sizes, and guarantees the reorganizing of those packets in the right order (the [[Internet Protocol]] has no data availability)
    - The [[TCP/IP]] model works together to ensure the communication happened over IP.
