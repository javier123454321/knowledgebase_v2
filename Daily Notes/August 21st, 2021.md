            - {{character-count}}
                - I am a software developer - formerly an architectural designer - husband, and a passionately curious tinkerer and explorer.

I find myself often building, and through the years, I have built furniture, houses, a business, web apps, disaster relief shelters, and a business, among other things. 

Lately I have been focusing on creating a startup for content creators to transition from the internet of media distribution, to the internet of value through blockchain technology.

        - Can you give me an example of a situation where you used creative or innovative thinking to eliminate frustration with a product or process? What was the problem and solution? (Please be detailed) *
            - For a previous business, we found that we were repeating an action which took an average of about 45 seconds up to 100 times a day. We were taking pictures of people, doing small edits on photoshop, printing them on the spot, uploading them, to our servers, and giving people a unique access code. 

The first step to fix this was to build a better upload mechanism, which came with access to a unique code. I built that in laravel. 

The second thing to automate was photoshop. We found that photoshop actions could save us a lot of time in making the process simpler. I figured that a single key combination could add filters, save, and print at once. This saved us on some of the most time consuming process, but it did not allow the employees to choose what the name of the file would be, so it would always overwrite the previous file. 

We managed this by building a python script that would keep a watcher on the folder that photoshop was saving to, and every time the new version of the file was saved, it was renamed and uploaded to our servers automatically, no need to keep track of the files through photoshop.

In the end, this process saved us hundreds of man hours in the company. 
        - What have you been learning about in your free time over the past year and why? *
            - So besides always bettering my skills around as a developer, which I deliberately make an effort to maintain, the pandemic made me look for new ways to remain in shape, which led me to take up jump rope. Staring a computer most of the time through my work necessitates an activity that will balance that. I will say that it is a way to let loose, and there is a surprising community which combines a previous obsession of mine (shuffle dancing to edm music) with jump rope. 
        - Tell us about the last time your opinion on something changed and why? (Preferably a topic aside from politics) *
            - I used to think that the new world that cryptocurrencies will bring about was going to be through smart contracts replacing legal arbitration completely. That the imperfect issues around human ambiguity would be replaced by the perfect mathematical precision of computer code. A world without arbiters and middlemen, where people participate with the network as the thing that determines the outcome mathematically, perfectly.

I found that to be a bit naive. After looking at some arguments and thinking about it, I now see human ambiguity and value judgements as an extremely valuable feature of legal arbitration in certain contexts. There is just so much utility in interpreting intent, especially as it comes to edge cases, and at best we will have a hybrid smart contract with a mediator clause that grants rights to a third party to decide based on value judgements, which is not so much different than what we have today.  

Human value judgements are just necessary when it comes to human endeavors. Computers are notoriously inept at interpreting those, so I don't think we will be seeing a future without the need for human arbitration anytime soon, I hope.

        - How do you define your life’s greatest struggle to date? *
            - When I moved to the US from Guatemala, I was 14. I came here legally but my mom had very little. She worked as a cashier at a smoothie shop and would bring leftover chicken from the kitchen there. Whereas we were middle class in Guatemala, we struggled in the US. I started hanging with the wrong crowd in high school, getting into drugs and self destructive behavior, got in legal trouble, and did things I am not proud of. A close friend died of an overdose. Another started doing heroin and I never heard from her again. I was stoned all the time, and would do little but party. 

Around my 21st birthday, I met a group of buddhists, all former hippies, explorers of 'altered states' and they showed me that I didn't need the drugs to feel good. That because your mind is capable of these experiences. It doesn't need anything external to feel that, and most importantly, you can get there without the inebriation. I saw substances as a way to get to something deeper, but it's something that was there all along. I decided to quit everything and focus on personal growth. I realized that being the best version of myself is not just a nice thought, but an ethical duty. 
        - Tell us about your side hustles. What are you tinkering with today and why? *
            - So the 'side hustle' that I was working on before dedicating my after work hours to Valorize was a platform for turning any online course into a cohort based course. Anyone could sign up and provide a structure to any free course they find online and recruit other people interested in the same course at the same pace. I got decently far in the prototype stage, but did the classic mistake of not talking to users first.

It never took off and I decided to stop it to dedicate my time to valorize. I ended up finding a few mentees to teach about programming through it so it made it a very fulfilling experiment.
        - What is the last thing you read or listened to and why did that interest you? *
            - The latest thing has been The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People. It is an exploration at being a person that has high value. This is in opposition to the type of person that behaves a certain way, or does things to gain favors from other. I have found that this books align closely with habits that I have been striving towards, habits such as taking responsibility for my life and situation, and not allowing myself to act as though I was in autopilot. It is an exercise in being deliberate and useful, through introspection. 
        - What’s the current habit you're building and why? (if it’s not too personal) *
            - I have been doing buddhist meditation for about a decade, and the last 3 years have been a serious attempt at doing it daily. I find that the greatest barrier to achieving my potential is the limits that I set for myself. These limits are artificial, they are socially conditioned and prevent me from being as useful to others as I can be. If could be the best version of myself, help others, and create value, what else is there to strive for? Getting out of my way is the best way I have found to do so, and meditation the tool that allows for that.
    - [[blockchain]]
        - Why use Blockchain at all? You can do everything that you can do on bitcoin and ethereum using a sql database. It is probably faster and cheaper too. 
        - The one thing that blockchains give you is that they are open. That is it. Everything else, the mining, the architecture, the p2p connections, all of that is fluff.
