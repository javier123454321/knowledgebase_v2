                - Has this minimal print style interface, very clean and to the point. Does forms and interactivity elegantly, it feels like a modern application with a retro design.

    - [[Architecture]] and [[programming]]
        - Honestly, the biggest difference is the former's approach to depth of understanding the domain which it is working on. In programming culture, it is all about the tool you use, the problem space is secondary, in architecture, business concerns are necessary as it is more of a consulting relationship.
        - This breaks down at some point because of the business side of programming. When creating a company, you have people like [[Michael Seibel]] saying things like . Hold the problem tightly, Hold the customer tightly, hold the solution loosely.. In this regard software development is far more advanced than architecture for today's world. The people that are putting a stake into the ground and claiming that the world can be a certain way are not the designers of buildings, they sit around theorizing while society passes them by. It is the software geeks that are leveraging incredible pulleys that magnify their potential contribution to the world. 
            - The New Distributed Ontological Frontline
        - Architecture, after all, is a service. A service for capital to manifest in the built environment. There is skin in the game, but only reputation wise. The architect risks with liability, with contract, however it is the person hiring  them that is truly staking on and putting risk into the building. It is a costly effort. Developers, industry leaders, people that have the capital to create the built environment are hte ones that shape it, not the architects. 
            - That is why there is this constant tension in the profession. No one understands the value of good design, says the architectural professor that is the leader of the institution, well that's not the case. No one wants to put skin in the game for your vision. How can the architectural profession go beyond its limitations to shorten the build/feedback cycle with real people. It is incredibly inefficient to begin with.
        - Professionally, the current state of architecture is much more similar to a software consultant. A business need meets a person that sells their services to meet that business need
            - [[Architecture]] is not as efficient as tech [[startups]] at changing the world
                - startups figured out a model for creating works that affects people by integrating feedback loops into the process
                    - Feedback loops in architecture are limited to the client relationship, not real stakeholders. There is an abstraction layer here that is not met. It is centralized into a trusted third party
                        - ### No skin in the game for architects
                            - Architecture, after all, is a service. A service for capital to manifest in the built environment. There is skin in the game, but only reputation wise. The architect risks with liability, with contract, however it is the person hiring  them that is truly staking on and putting risk into the building. It is a costly effort. Developers, industry leaders, people that have the capital to create the built environment are hte ones that shape it, not the architects. 
                - architects are consultants for other business processes their terms are seldom pushed forward
                    - this is unfortunate because architects are amazing synthesizers of information
                    - exceptions 
                        - fuller's dymaxion house
                        - tactical urbanism
                - Architecture seems to just be at the whim of the capitalist spectrum, and not a driver of capitalist production.
                    - It is a service.
    - Design and science have always attracted me. [[Architecture]] andÂ [[Frontend]] seem to have many similarities
        - Frontend is the technicality, UX is the process of thinking through the social solutions, both are compelling equally to me. 
        - I cannot narrow my focus to a single area, I really hope that I am right that being a [[generalist]] is a good approach to things.
