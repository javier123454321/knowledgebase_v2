- [[Quick Capture]]
    - Making time for myself. 
        - A massive character flaw of mine is that I tend to have this guilt feeling of just using time for myself. If I am not working for memory captures, coding for work, working on the streaming page or DW-connect, or writing or reading, I am wasting my time. It feels like I actually believe that.

        - About Dewey's approach to education
    - [[What went well?]]
        - Had a really nice day with [[Zselyke]].
    - [[What could be better?]]
        - Need to learn to say no. Also, I am a bit impulsive, and want things that are not necessarily good for me.
