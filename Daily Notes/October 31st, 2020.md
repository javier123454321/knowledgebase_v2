    - How can we develop transformative tools for thought?

        - The internet and the computer always served as a promise for tools for expanding our thinking...
            - Has it delivered?
            - What work is being done to deliver that
            - How do you approach the question in a scientific way
    - Books are an innefective tools for processing information

        Books are limited by their medium
            - People seem to not recall the facts of a book, merely a broad stroke of what the book was originally saying
        Lectures seem to not work either
            - Like books, Lectures seem to work on the same assumption that you can transmit information from teacher to student.
            - Provable false, and is at the core of Dewey's critique of traditional education 
                - His criticism of the old idea in education is incredibly pertinent, however. Wisdom cannot be transfered, as it is not an object. Wisdom is living in each individual, and is only acquired through the experience that got to make the person who he is now. 
            - Lectures are worse than books, because the medium is not constrained as books are, yet they are built on faulty assumptions that students can acquire information from a teacher, as though learning can be transfered
        The thinking that can be garnered through reading books is actually processed through a metacognitive process of synthesizing, summarizing, and creating connections between this work and the work of others

                - At the core of the argument is an idea about why we read and write, and how we can use that to produce something valuable from it. Reading is not just acquiring information [( 1 )](((bTl37ljSz))) but the goal of reading, researching, writing, and publishing is to garner something valuable from that process.
            - The process of thinking that happens is the goal of gathering information, not just getting t the end of a book
        Textbooks have a stronger model of cognition defining them
            - Read and process through exercises
            - Textbooks are usually accompanied by courses, and few people learn just through going through a textbook
            - The exercises are supposed to solve a specific problem, but also draw greater insights about the larger picture of a problem
                - What is the feedback about the metacognitive process that the student goes through in a textbook?
                - What if they get the exercise but are missing the larger picture
                    - There is little to no course correction, other than review the material again
        Courses combine this with an accountability metric as well as a feedback and community aspect Also introduces Pathos, the professor's love of the subject can shine through

        The idea is to invent a medium that has an idea about learning embedded into it necessarily
            - A form that is derived out of observation of the world
            - People struggle to absorb new material when their working memory is already overloaded [( 1 )](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4207727)
