        - Hey, I'm a firm believer in the fact that the landscape will be very different in a decade thanks to decentralized infrastructure. At the bottom of it is the fact that much more than investment vehicles, blockchains provide a data storage layer to the internet itself. The currencies are what allow you to write to this database, and that is a 10x idea for the future of the internet.
        - I am working on a platform to allow anyone to deploy their own token online. Much like the individual blog in the early internet, I believe that people can launch their own token now, and become an investment. A movement from the individual as the new media distribution platform to a publicly traded platform. I think this will unlock a lot of possibilities that don't exist yet because the tools to create them haven't been rolled out yet. It's an exciting space.

            - Hi Javier, What exactly do you mean by "currencies are what allow you to write to this database".
            - And also, what value does a new token provide? With blogs people could spread/consume information or just entertain themselves. As I see it, a new token has no inherent value. What do you think?
                - So the current internet is stateless, best we can do is store cookies from each site we visit. You don't want to give access to your database because that would be very insecure.
                - Blockchains at their core are a protocol for having a general database which is decentralized. Anyone can read from it, but if you want to write to it, you need to pay with the tokens of that blockchain. It's an open database where the rules of what is a valid transaction are laid out, and anyone can do CRUD operations so long as they follow the protocol. This is why it's such an important invention.
                - As far as the tokens, I agree that most will provide no value, much like most blogs or twitter accounts don't. However, there are some that are very valuable. Right now, there is no way to 'invest' in an early stage creator that you think will be big in the future. Yet, as an early fan, you are part of the reason that the creator will get more reach.
                - Basically if you make it so that you could capture the future value of the token of a creator, then finding 'moonshots' will be a new industry. On top of that, you can build things like 'investors only feeds' for investors, weighted voting, merch, and decisions on what to create next once you have enough investors. I wrote a white paper on its early stages, I would appreciate if you have some commentsÂ https://www.notion.so/valorize/Valorize-White-Paper-58fa3161c09e4ec2807cb0ea5d581d8f.
