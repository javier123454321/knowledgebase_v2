# Devices for Networking #

## Cables ##
### Copper ###
Used and usually twisted and insulated. The binary signals are sent by messing with the current. (Sending Network Pulse)

#### Categories ####
Cat 1, Cat 5, etc

How a cable is twisted affects how the current is being sent.

##### Cross Talk ####
Signals that are picked up by other cables

#### Fiber ###
Tubes of glass that use pulses of light to represent the underlying data.
Quicker but more expensive and brittle.

## Hubs ##
Cables allow you to connect two nodes. 

A Hub is a physical layer device which allow for connections for multiple devices at once.

#### Collision Domain ###
Only one device can send data at the same time. It shuts down if many devices send

#### Network Switch ###
A device that lives on the Data Layer, inspects the contents of teh ethernet request and sends data to the appropriate place.

## Routers ##
A Device that sends data to an external network. Contain information of how to send data all over the world. 

Home Routers connect to the ISP. 

Core routers share data around the Border Gateway Protocol BGP

There can be dozens of routers involved in a simple request. 

## [[Servers]] ##
[[Servers]] provide data to something requesting that data. Computer programs can be [[Servers]] and clients to each other. Almost all Nodes are [[Servers]] and Clients at one point.

Sometimes we refer to an email server when it is also a client to a dns server. 
**We use the words (client or server) to describe the primary purpose of our network nodes**
