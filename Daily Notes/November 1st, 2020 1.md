        - Glenn Greenwald going independent
            - The role of institutions is fading from underneath them. There are very little foundations for them to stand on. 
            - The intercept was started by him, but institutions like that develop their own tendencies which could very well be outside of the way that they originally operated.
                - An institution, once defined takes a life of its own. It has hunger cues - what it is after, avoidance of death, etc.
            - More and more people will go the completely independent route, and take with that new ideas and new collectives will form 
        - You cannot just define yourself as anti something, that gives you no metric of whether or not you are being successful at what you are doing 
            - A danger in putting elements in terms of binaries and then deciding to create a reality that is in opposition of what has been tried is that you don't allow the reality to take shape in the way that it naturally would. If the entire definition of something is against something else, then it will never be what it can be.

            - Architecture seems to just be at the whim of the capitalist spectrum, and not a driver of capitalist production.
