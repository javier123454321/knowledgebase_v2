- One interesting piece of architectural criticism, that I tend to go back to, is this piece by architect and theorist Mark Foster Gage on Killing Simplicity[1](((A_MLsQ2af))). He argues quite convincingly that the quest to make architecture about the parameters it relates to, about something outside of itself, the adjacencies, the urban fabric, the direction of wind, sun, noise, and any factor that is outside of the purely architectural, makes our built environment recede from our attention [2](((A_MLsQ2af))) and making architecture more and more the purview of engineers, sociologists, programmers, and anything but architects. I tend to disagree with the criticism that the fault of architecture is in not being self referential enough, or that its engagement with political, social, and functional vectors are at fault for the lack of relevance. However, this debate touches something in the architectural imagination, produces stark proponents of either side, and it does bring up certain notions that I believe are worthy of consideration and I would like to tease out in this post. As a disclaimer, some of the thinkers which are referred to are beyond my scope of understanding, and let’s hope that my engagement with their ideas as an amateur can be sufficient to contribute, at the very least, an elucidation of a contemporary polemic which affects my profession.
- Mark Foster Gage belongs to a relatively recent school of thought for architects, which applies a new discourse in philosophy referred to as Object-Oriented Ontology. The aim is simple, and could arguably be considered noble, at least ernestly born out of a desire to maintain architecture as a relevant discipline in the increasingly chaotic, information saturated, and image mediated world. In its simplest terms, Gage argues that the more that we try to undermine architecture by making it about its parts, its LEED certification, its Elements – as Koolhaas did in the 2014 Venice Biennale, the more that the form is representative and determined by the flows of air, culture, context, and any other parameter as is often diagrammed to be, the worse we are as a profession. Likewise, the more that we evaluate or “Overmine” architecture by its ability to engage and affect social, political, and ecological processes, or to make architecture about a metaphorical form, or about a simplistic and readable big idea, we look more and more impotent as a profession to do anything significant. Gage almost pleads, __“That architecture and discrete buildings are connected to the larger world is not in dispute, but whether buildings can be legitimised as architecture by these relations should be. Architects must, of course, think of the environment and make every effort to keep all of our physical and social ecologies democratic, healthy, and productive. But these ambitions are not sufficient to justify the production of a work of architecture.”__ [3](((SE2pehU2W))). The polemic is thus to create an architecture that points us to the possible, without it or its author knowing what that possible is. We can never really know the totality of possible flows which can influence the morphology of the built environment, and to prioritize any particular one closes off the possibility for something new, something “weird” to emerge.
- [[Patrik Schumacher]] denies that this is a new strand in the direction of architectural theory, and relates the possibility for architecture to make manifest new realities in the Deluzean concept of the virtual, which has been in vogue with architects and theoreticians for a lot longer than Graham Harman’s speculative realism. But giving the devil its due, and in an atypical attempt at truce making and finding a commonality in the avant garde discourse of the profession, he acknowledges that parametricism did leave this emphasis on discovery and speculation behind (and he gladly welcomes it’s reintroduction) as it was developing as a theory into the state of maturation which it is arriving to today. [4](((y4ScEU6x3)))And indeed the concept of virtuality as put up in contrast to actuality which Deleuze bases his entire ontology of difference and becoming, has been instrumental to recent architectural theorizing. As Schumacher puts it himself, and as Greg Lynn put it in the early nineties, as Massumi popularized into the discourse and Kwinter elaborated on, there is an idea that virtuality, as differentiated from potential, is real for its function as an attractor or a vector towards a particular actuality that has consequences. The virtual is different from potential in the terms what something could be, but it is in an ontological sense interacting with the actual in its process of becoming.[5](((uHpeBBlXE)))The entire essay is an attempt at ‘subduing’ or at least ‘incorporating’ the aim of OOO into Schumacher’s parametric style which he declares is the only appropriate style for the current epoch by linking the withdrawal of objects to the emphasis in the early days of parametricism on the virtual. This ‘virtuality’, as Schumacher argues, served in a manner similar to the ‘objects’ which Harman posits to possess ontologically irreducible status. Not in something that is accessible phenomenologically, but something that draws the actual to become something else that is not premeditated or imbued with a static meaning.
- In architectural terms, this has been talked about often in terms of designing open ended spaces that can adapt to a multiplicity of functions that are not premeditated by the design. An anticipation of [[Complexity]] which might be as old as modernism itself.[6 ](((j58Xh494n)))But this is not what the design schools at Sci-Arc and Pratt are producing. They are producing a strange reality, challenging ideas of what is even possible, calling forth dreams and visions of the bizarre, the weird, and speculating in a Lovecraftean manner what a world beyond our senses might actually look like.[7 ](((qcP-2HGRI))). Here we go back to a question that Schumacher asks in his essay __“This is one of my main questions and challenges to Harman: Would a shallow, isolated, minimalist, slab building, dissected into disconnected, repetitive floors and cells still count as a withdrawn object with hidden depth? Because such a building, could, in principle, engage in new relations, and might harbor unknown capacities that could be actualized in new circumstances, for example, in dereliction(…) If so, then this philosophy cannot guide us. We need to move from sweeping generalizations to differentiations and correlations that can guide design work.”__[8](((uEv8Sp9Vd))) So he reveals a common goal for both parametricism and Object Oriented Architecture (for lack of a better term) of creating the conditions for high degrees of virtuality to appear, which he argues is achievable through [[Complexity]].

- The main concern for Schumacher, the guiding principle of architecture is its function as communication[8](https://graspingdesign.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/schumacher-harman-objects-virtuality-and-the-role-of-philosophy-in-architecture/[[fn8]]). And I think this might be the divergence, for when you see the designs that Gage undertakes, you see a subversion of the idea of communication at all, where symbols are mutated though a monstruous subversion of syntax. Though one feels that there is something to be understood in his constructions, it is ultimately illegible. I think this is where he would argue that his objects present the possibility of something new. Zaha Hadid’s projects, being born out of deconstructivism, eliminated much of the vocabulary of classical and modern architecture, yet they attempted a legible communication of relationships. In fact, the work was to a large degree, based on the presumption that you could make legible and explicit some connections through the manipulation of the built environment.[9](((l22xhggc4)))
- Indeed, when Graham Harman responds to Schumacher, his first real argument, although not much elaborated in the essay itself, is in the fact that communication between social systems as conceived by Luhman, and to which Schumacher differentiated architecture as belonging to this category, is ‘deeply problematic’. Harman sees an almost unsurmountable barrier to the communication between independent systems seeking homeostasis[10](((RpfSGZjEl))). More than that, Harman is making a point that objects are more than their relations at every point and irreducible to their relations. It seems his entire project is to talk about objects as they are, real, inaccessible, strange, but with consequences that affect their surroundings, though in strange and unpredictable ways.[11](((IUYLL-jFJ))). And the architectural elaboration to this idea is to maintain the ‘objectness’ of a work and not relegate it to the impossibly complex and consuming networked society we have produced. Schumacher prioritizes the role of architecture to discover network synergies, and derides OOO’s architecture for its formal opacity, specifically this oppacity as is going against parametricism’s dogmas. Yet the transgression of parametricism’s dogma’s is a hobby of architecture students and practicioners being guided by OOO. The claim of it becoming a subsidiary style is a bit dubious to me.
- However, what I find most valuable about this, is Schumacher’s point about the use of a philosophical theory in architecture, which Harman unfortunately leaves out of his response. He argues that __“Before articulating a constructive use of philosophy by architecture, I want to bluntly state that neither an architectural approach nor its results can ever be justified, acquire meaning, earn recognition, or attain heightened cultural value through its alignment with a philosophy, no matter how great. Architecture’s merit depends solely on how well buildings work in the real world for people who are neither architects nor philosophers.__“[12](((ukv7PFCfA))) And I believe this underrated elaboration of the instrumental role of philosophy in the social role of architecture is where the contribution of this exchange lies. Schumacher situates the profession of architecture within social processes, and as a direct communicator of the underlying social systems that produce it. And it is easy to get consumed by a ‘beautiful’ theory. Yet, it is never enough to represent a theory in architectural terms, but to gage how it embeds itself into the physical, social, economic, and cultural dimensions. Schumacher’s claim that OOO’s architecture does not seem to me to have developed sufficient discriminating criteria seems to hold, and it should serve as an alert of where the project should go.
- So to conclude, I agree with Harman, that it is too early for Object Oriented Architecture to be considered a subsidiary style of parametricism. In Schumacher’s teleological justification of the parametric epoch in architecture he is rash to criticize and to absolve new experimentation for failing to follow his own dictates. Yet, there is something poetic about object oriented architecture’s turn towards the speculative, because even if it is not real we can interact with it in concrete terms, just as we interact with the real. But I definitely agree with Schumacher that the evaluating parameters for a successful project must be developed quickly by the proponents of this new style, and these have to be grounded upon the social functionality of architecture. We have been seduced by romantic theories in the past that have had disastrous effects in culture, modernism being but one of them. If we allow this weird reality to reconfigure our built environment, it must be to the function of the people that it is meant to serve, not to serve the ego of the creator, because we have an idea of what that might result in.

        - The argument stems from [[Heidegger]]’s analysis of the term sometimes called ‘Handiness’ which looks at the way that Dasein or a being that is aware of its existence functions in a world which always already exists before we can analyse it. The utility of things is not tied to our analytical understanding of how they work. Tools recede from our experience when they perform their function properly, they are a means-to something, and that something is what receives our attention. It is not until the tool stops functioning that our analytic/theoretical understanding of the tool comes into our experience of using that tool.

        - Manuel DeLanda summarizes this aspect of Deleuze’s ontology by comparing extensive vs. intensive characteristics in thermodynamics, things such as length are extensive, and therefore divisible whereas temperature is intensive, dividing a liquid at 45 degrees in two equal parts still yields 45 degrees in both parts. Intensities are productive when differentially combined, and the movement that they create is guided by a virtual attractor that is not yet actualised but is as real as what is actually there.
    - 6. Modernism’s fascination with the free plan as theorized and developed by many, including its main proponents like, Mies, Wright, LeCorbusier were some of the first attempts at creating an architecture of indeterminacy. The flexibility was visualized reducto ad absurdum by superstudio’s the continuous monument.
