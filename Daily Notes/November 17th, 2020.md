            - Given that (mathematical) education has been mostly in the open domain, there is no reason to charge a quarter million for a degree. 
            - The outliers in the pedagogical ability bell curve are already taking their massive share of the market.
                - Why would you listen to your professor if you can find the best professor in the world to give you the same lecture, only significantly better
                - The mathematics don't work out otherwise
            - crypto unlocks 250 trillion in international finance networks 
                - the cash use case is not so much more appealing. For jurisdictional legal face to face transactions, absolutely use apple pay
                    - this assumes legal competence,  not mass negligence and inflation

            - In a sense, it is the capitalization on Heidegger's analysis of tools
        - all models are wrong, but some are useful. One that I believe is actually providing a lot of utility in terms of a way of looking at the world is [[graph theory]] Network science. In these, the primary value and the ontological status off nodes in the network are defined by their relationship to other nodes. This is useful because in reality we are much more than the distinct object that we sometimes identified with. For example we are all a network of cultural programs that we have had imprinted on our brains since we are little. We are also a node in the network that graphs all of the human relationships that we've developed over our lifetime. Finding the degree connectivity {{[[∆]]:6+2}} or the closeness centrality {{[[∆]]:11+2}} of ourselves in our networks provides an opportunity to combine different networks together and achieve something novel.
