        - all models are wrong, but some are useful. One that I believe is actually providing a lot of utility in terms of a way of looking at the world is [[graph theory]] Network science. In these, the primary value and the ontological status off nodes in the network are defined by their relationship to other nodes. This is useful because in reality we are much more than the distinct object that we sometimes identified with. For example we are all a network of cultural programs that we have had imprinted on our brains since we are little. We are also a node in the network that graphs all of the human relationships that we've developed over our lifetime. Finding the degree connectivity {{[[∆]]:6+2}} or the closeness centrality {{[[∆]]:11+2}} of ourselves in our networks provides an opportunity to combine different networks together and achieve something novel. 
        - What are you? Who are you? The Buddha 2500 years ago pointed to the fact that if you take this question seriously, you arrive at nothing, you arrive at the potential of space to experience. Are you your body? Which body? Which part of your body? Cutting yourself in half does not create two of you. There is no essense in the physical world which actually defines you. Likewise, your thoughts are changing even faster than your body, your opinions naturally evolving over time (hopefully) and your emotions changing wildly from the morning to lunchtime. No matter how hard you try, you cannot point to anything objective that is you. 
The potential to be aware though, that's always there, will always be there, and is much larger than any one aspect of you. This potential is not personal, and this potential can leverage the objective world more than can possibly be conceived.
