        - noesis
            - a connection between the human intellect and the divine intellect - a close correlary but not quite.
            -  In the end all words are a concept which will not correlate with the experience and therefore insufficient to describe it.
        - knowing we are all connected vs experiencing yourself as connected to everything. Objective observation is put into question,  and subjective experience comes to the forefront in this approach. 
        - [[all models are wrong but some are useful]]
            - being an insufficient descriptor of reality is not a condition for invalidating the entirety of it. 
            - Totalitarian and absolute concepts are dangerous because of this. [[communism]] is an epitome of this example.

        - Topic:: [[E-Learning]]
            - how you reward students is the critical component
            - can you design a system that rewards learning. The problem is that people are always trying to figure out how to game the system based on the rewards that the system has built in.
