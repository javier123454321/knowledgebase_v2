Abstract:
Summary:
	Each 'asset' on the network is based on a schema. It basically uses commitments in data on UTXOs
	[[Fungible Token Transfers]]
		Require the following:
			an invoice
			A prototype
			A fee
			Change - like bitcoin, it uses UTXOs
			Consignment - A proof that you are able to spend those tokens all the way to genesis to your transfer
			Transaction - the commit which is put onto the bitcoin blockchain 
	The entire system is validated by each client which wants to recieve the asset..
