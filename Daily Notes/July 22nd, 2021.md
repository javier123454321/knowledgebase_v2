    - [[Why Big Companies Can't Innovate]] [[Harvard Business Review]]
        - When you are starting out as a business, you get rewarded for finding new ideas in the market. Once you are a running company, your machine is designed to do what it is already doing better. Finding operational efficiencies in your processes create more profit. This is good, but not what startups are good at. 
        - A [[startups]] success is in how well it identifies a gap in the market and matches it to a solution. 
        - Once that has been done, the game of doing that better begins. 
            - Big companies cannot do new things because they have spent all their time optimizing for what they are already doing. These constraints are good for maintaining profits, not finding new solutions. To innovate, you need to go against the goals of the organization...

                    - as a startup efficiency should actually be last on the list
    - [[Postgress vs MySql]]
        - [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9n_-_oLrbM)
            - An index is different than a table, similar to the alphabetical dividers in. traperkeepers.
                - The index stores the pointer to the first row in the group.
            - Every index in Postgress acts as a pointer to a unique identifier to a table
                - Index points to a row in table -> all point to table directly
            - Updates:
                - MySql indexes points to a table, but secondary indexes point to the primary key value that corresponds to the table
                - In Postgress, an update to the table changes each index, they are like dependencies
            - Reads
                - You already have 'access' to the table based on index in Postgress
                - In MySql, you need to get the primary key then read the table. 
        - [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI3eO14Fy90) - not very good
            - Postgress is sql compliant where mysql does not necessarily do so
            - Certain queries operate differently in the two systems.
