Look at my previous videos
	Once a Miner has a block with the previous block's hash and a list of transactions which are verified and valid,
	The miner is trying to find a 'nonce' that will hash the block to have a certain number of zeroes in front.
	Once the miner finds this nonce, they publish their block and all other miners can verify it for themselves.
	This creates a chain of valid blocks which all miners verify going back to the first transaction ever, or the genesis block.
