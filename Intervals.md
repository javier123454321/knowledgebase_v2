- Major is the quality and the degree is the quality
- ## Qualities of intervals
    - D E F G A B C D
    - 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
- in the key of D, the 7th is meant to be C#, so C is lower by a half step. When it is lowered by a half step from (4 semitones to 3), this is called a Minor. 
- The unison 4th 5th and the octave can be described as perfect. If the interval is larger, it is augmented, and if you make it smaller, it is diminished. 
- From E to G in C major you have 3 intervals
    - E  F  F# G
        - S  S  S   = 3s = Minor 3rd
- Adding a semitone gives a Major	   
    - E  F  F# G  G#
        - S  S  S  S  = 4s = Major 3rd
- Adding another gives an augmented
    - E  F  F# G  G# B
        - S  S  S  S  S  = 5s = Major 3rd
