- ## The Circle of Fifths
- ```
- Sharps  <-         -> Flats               Flats  <-            -> Sharps 
    - C                                          C
    - G              F                           F             G
    - D                       Bb               Bb                       D
    - A                           Eb           Eb                           A
        - E                      Ab                Ab                      E
            - Cb            C#                         Db            B
            - B     F#      Db                         C#     Gb     Cb
                - Gb                                        F#
- ```
- C has no accidentals
- F has one Flat
- B has two ...
- Deriving the keys when you travel towards the flats
- The fourth is the new flat.
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- F  G  A  Bb C  D  E  F
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- Bb C  D  Eb F  G  A  Bb
- ```
- Deriving the keys when you travel towards the flats
- The 7th becomes the next sharp
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- G  A  B  C  D  E  F# G
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- D  E  F# G  A  B  C# D
- ```
- They go up to 7 sharps or 7 flats
- C# or Cb
- ```
    - C       |  0 accidentals
- G       F   |  1 accidentals
- D       Bb  |  2 accidentals
- A       Eb  |  3 accidentals
- E       Ab  |  4 accidentals
- B       Db  |  5 accidentals
- F#      Gb  |  6 accidentals
- C#      Cb  |  7 accidentals
- ```
- ### Minor Scales
- All minor scales are defined by lowering the third.*
- Types of Minor Scales
- Natural  - Start with Major and drop the 3d 6th and 7th notes a half step
- Harmonic - Start with Major and drop the 3rd and 6th notes a half step
- Melodic  - Start with Major and drop the 3rd
- Natural
- For the C minor scale
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
    - Eb       Ab Bb  
- ```
- Harmonic
- For the C minor Harmonic scale
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
    - Eb       Ab  
- ```
- [It changes the 7th degree](Minor%20Keys.md#^38b220)
- Melodic
- Is one scale going down and another scale going up
- For the C minor Melodic scale ascending
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
    - Eb
- ```
- For the C minor Melodic scale descending it is the same as Harmonic Minor
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- C  D  E  F  G  A  B  C 
    - Eb       Ab Bb
- ```
- There is a difference where you are going to and where you are coming from
- ## Lesson 2
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QV5bD6nBQQc&list=RDQMTWqSLtfI0Iw&index=2](Youtube)
- Each key has the major and a relative (natural) minor scale. So if you take a key like D major:
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- D  E  F# G  A  B  C# D
- ```
- You must find the Natural minor with two sharps (the B minor)
    - ^
- Take any major scale and start on the 6 to play the minor.
- So take the 6th degree of a major to play a minor.
- ```
- Major  |  Minor
    - C    |    A
    - G    |    E
    - D    |    B
    - A    |    Gb
    - E    |    Db
    - B    |    Ab
    - Gb   |    Eb
    - Db   |    Bb
    - Ab   |    F
    - Eb   |    C
    - Bb   |    G
    - F    |    D
- ```
- So taking G Major to Natural Minor
- ```
- 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
- G  A  B  C  D  E  F# G
    - 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8/1
    - E  F# G  A  B  C  D  E    <- Natural Minor
        - G#          D#      <- Harmonic Minor
        - G#                  <- Ascending Melodic Minor
- ```
- ### Intervals
- They are diferent wether you are dealing with the 
- 8 5 4 1
- Can be Augmented Perfect or Diminished
- 7 6 3 2
- Can be Major Minor augmented or dimished
- if you are playing two notes and the top note is in the major scale of the bottom note
- play a 1 and a 6
- G and E   (major)
- G and Eb  (minor)
- G and Ebb (diminished)
- G and E#  (augmented)
- for 1 and 4
- Bb and A   (augmented fourth)
- Bb and Ab  (perfect)
- Bb and Abb (diminished)
- ## Lesson 3
- ```
- A  8      A  7
- P  5      M  6
- d  4      m  3  
    - 1      d  2
- ```
- C and G 
- from C to G -> perfect 5th
- from G to C -> perfect 4th
- When you invert a perfect interval, they remain perfect.
- E to B#
- from E  to B# -> augmented 5th
- from B# to E  -> diminished 4th
- Augmented intervals become diminished when inverted
- Diminished becomes augmented
- In both cases the interval amounts add up to 9
- Augmented 7 becomes diminished 2nd
- Augmented 6 becomes diminished 3rd
- Major intervals become minor intervals
- So interval numbers add up to 9
- Major <-> minor
- Diminished <-> Augmented
- Perfect <-> Perfect
- ### Consonant vs Dissonant
- Consonant sounds are the 
- 8th (octave) and 5th 
- Major and Minor 3rd and 6ths 
- Augmented or Dimished 7 and 2 are Dissonant
- 4th can be trickier
- Consonance is Relaxation and Dissonance is Tension
- ## Lesson 2
- Interval identifications (Should come back to this, not entirely clear)
- write the Augmented 2nd below the Cb. Start with the letter, we know that it is some kind of b.
- For C regular, Minor 2nd, is B for Major 2nd it
