Abstract:
Summary:
	Bitcoin is a new asset class that creates a market for hashpower, by assigning it economic value.
		"" The purpose of this system is not to improve the efficiency over the traditional distributed computation, but to formalize and publicize _how_ the process is done. ""
	The purpose of hashing is to serve as a cryptographically verifiable timestamp for computation done in an adversarial distributed system.

Settlement assurance is the critical foundation to the adoption and longevity of a settlement network. The settlement assurance, or [economic finality](https://www.bis.org/publ/work765.pdf), is considered strong when the ordering of the transactions is resistant to tampering. As the blockchain propagates and the network hashpower continues to accumulate, the [“energy attached”](https://bitcointechtalk.com/the-anatomy-of-proof-of-work-98c85b6f6667) increases the block’s [economic weight](https://medium.com/@nic__carter/its-the-settlement-assurances-stupid-5dcd1c3f4e41). The cost of acquiring 51%+ of the global hashpower may become too expensive compared to the possible gains from launching an attack.```
