### Build Relationships with influencers in your area.
Find a food blogger or an influencer with a significant following in your city (over 4k subscribers) and contact them. Find them by searching by location on instagram.

Just reach out to them and tell them that you love what they are doing, and connect with them on a personal level. Building connections is such an integral part of how we can amplify our voices.

Do this to build a relationship, not to get free advertisement, and they will become an amazing advocate for your brand.
