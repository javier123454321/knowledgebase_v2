        - It seems that USPS cannot deny carrying a package to deliver, regardless if they people asking are ANTIFA, KKK, and other such orgs
        - Fedex is bound by the same Common Carrier pledge
        - Verizon can’t cancel the Klan’s recruiting phone number,
even if that number is publicly advertised so that Verizon can know how it’s being
used without relying on any private information.

        - This is not only important if you are a group, it impedes political interference. 
The Times, however, provides a function of judgement in their editorial decisions, this gives them the right to deny an ad to recruit from the KKK if they want.

            - Facebook is creating a newsletter service that is meant to compete with substack. This service is offering unlimited subscriptions at no fees. 
                - Is this antitrust, anticompetitive? Amazon did the same with Amazon Mom, Google with Google Photos

            - > This is one of SV's main competitive advantages vs not just the rest of the US, but the rest of the world: the amount of available financial capital to pour into scaling up quickly, which of course happens at a loss - sales generally lag costs and especially fixed costs. 
If you include human capital, it's almost all of SV's competitive advantage: co-location of the people and the money to scale up.
        - There is a difference between operating at a loss to get off the ground until your sales match your expenses, vs drowning out the competitor because you have large capital allocations to make.
            - The latter allows you to ramp up pricing after it the competition has been taken out

        - [[startups]] vs Small Businesses
            - The main difference is one of potential payout. Scaling is defined by throwing man-hours into the problem for a Small Business. Dev Agencies are Small Businesses, Uber doesn't need to scale operations proportionate to the revenue.

        - It is a bad idea to use a single address to be the admin of a contract. Instead use a multisig wallet or a completely decentralized mechanism.
        - Defender allows you to watch a contract and create an admin action
            - Gives access to all functions of the contract.
            - It will provide an interface for multisig contracts
            - Gives other addresses in the multisig a chance to review and approve an admin action
        - Can also be used for upgradeable [[proxy]] 
            - The Defender process can verify that the storage patterns are compatible
        - A Relayer creates a private key to access specific actions in your code (instead of hosting a private key in a server)
            - The securevault stores the private key and you just use a keypair to access.
            - AWS Key Management Service secures and reads the relayer keys. It makes it impossible to to have access to keys outside of the public address. 
            - So you set a permission to the relayer, and trigger the relayer to call the function that you need.
        - A sentinel allows for monitoring different transactions and provide conditions that will trigger alerts
            - Provide notifications channels, slack, etc...
