- [[Alethia]] According to Heidegger
    - Truth is not the actual, fake gold is not "true" gold, but is real anyway.
        - Genuine gold is true gold. True gold is a being that conforms to an idea of what gold should be. 
            - Truth is the correspondence of the matter to knowledge
                - correspondence of a thing to our understanding of that thing
                - correspondence of that thing to a proposition of that thing
