        - It seems that the main issue in online learning based on this article, is that students tend to become disengaged when participating in online learning experiences. 
            - Michigan Virtual
                - Blended classroom approach to learn. Finds that AP students perform above average with the blended mode of education.

            - Being in school is not the same as learning
        - [[Khan Academy]]

            - Sal Khan started on a closet and moved up to worldwide enterprise.
                - The original classroom model was the teacher dictating the terms, and punishing the students for not understanding the material
                - If you did not 'get' the content that is supposed to be understood for that lesson, on that day, then you missed the opportunity to learn it.
                    - Good luck into the future.
                - Entrepreneurship is a series of tests
                    - Try something and see if your customers want what you are offering
                        - If yes continue, if no pivot
            - How to scale this:
                - Every succesful company is built by a team with complimentary skills
                - Sal did 6,000 lessons himself 
                    - Not scalable
                - Programmers that scale the reach of it
                - A bunch of generalists that have no depth in understanding on execution
                    - Sal is a visionary, not an executor, budgetor, etc
                    - Jenny Lee - Global strategy, identify early adopters, find you ambassadors
                    - Get results and documentation from the experiments
            - Localized investment, socialized impact
                - The externalities are not usually factored into a business, but with Khan, they are part of the value proposition
            - Some organizations are mission driven, even if the mission is unnatainable
                - Google - to organize the world's information
                - Khan - To provide a world class education to everyone, everywhere
                - The mission can be sliding, where it is an ambition you go towards but never reach, or as you get closer to reaching it, what it means changes.
