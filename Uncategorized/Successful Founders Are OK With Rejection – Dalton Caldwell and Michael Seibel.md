Abstract:
Summary:
	You need higher stakes than asking surveys. Try charging money, the stakes are much higher.
	Airbnb got a book of all the complaints of a customer by going and asking questions. 
	For twitch, what users wanted was easy to implement. Much easier than some of the brainstorming features. 
	Charging more is a way to prove hypothesis.  
	Sales has nothing to do with convincing.
		A sales conversation is a way to define how easy it is to disqualify the customers. Most calls should be finished in 5 minutes.
