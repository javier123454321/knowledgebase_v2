# Computer Hardware and Software #

#### Terminology:
BIOS (Basic input Output System)
Firmware - (more firm than software) can't be overwritten as easily as Software.
Partition - A section of disk space.

### Firmware
It is included (mechanically) on the hardware. Christmas lights have firmware. 

### The BIOS
#### An Operating System plugged into your MotherBoard
It is firmware and instructs your machine what to do once you power up.
The BIOS allows you to interact with the hardware and tell it what device it should load next. 

If you don't stop it by pressing f12, it will go to the next thing. This is where Partitions come in.
It goes into the disk partition

### Partitions
How your disk gets divided. 

Often have to remove the partitions in an old hard drive. 
Win and Mac have a failsafe partition. When you reboot in recover mode, you have the BIOS hand over control to the bootloader, where the BIOS sends control to the system boot. 
Mac's BIOS is smart enough to download the entire OS from the web, the BIOS has an IP stack.

### Dual booting
Setting up a partition designed to boot a OS in parallel to the default OS in the system.

### Live Booting
A Usb or other hardware that overrides the default boot order and gives the BIOS a new order to boot.

## Security
The only real measure of security is to *encrypt your Hard Drive*

## Update/Upgrade
Should always be up to date. Agreeing to put a server on the internet means that you are agreeing to keep it updated. *Otherwise it will get pwnd.*
