- Heidegger is doing the study of the nature of being in the most fundamental way possible. Husserl, his mentor, would focus on a regional ontology, asking the question in relation to the field which is being studied. 
    - A fundamental study of being is a universalist study of being. Asking the question of being in a phenomenological way. Hasn't been done since the presocratics.
        - All foundations of science, history, or philosophy are unfounded in this notion of being. We have been estranged from this question of being.
- To let that which shows itself be seen from itself in the very way in which it shows itself from itself
    - It is impossible to translate Heidegger into German.
        - He makes up words partly because the European language families have the distinction of being separated into subjects and objects as part of their language. 
            - Language pressuposes an ontology by its very structure. 
                - The question arises on how to prevent this bias regarding the presupposition of your understanding. 
                - Recognizing the structure of your understanding is part of the process of doing a Hermeneutic. 
                - Biases are a necessary product of producing an observation of the world. 
- Phenomenology itself is irreducibly preceded by existence in the world. 
    - [[Alethia]]
        - An uncovering (literally un-covering) or (dis-covering)
            - [[Alethia]] According to Heidegger
                - Truth is not the actual, fake gold is not "true" gold, but is real anyway.
                    - Genuine gold is true gold. True gold is a being that conforms to an idea of what gold should be. 
                        - Truth is the correspondence of the matter to knowledge
                            - correspondence of a thing to our understanding of that thing
                            - correspondence of that thing to a proposition of that thing
        - The truth of existence is an uncovering, not the correspondence theory of truth
            - Correspondence theory of truth - (Adequation)
                - Something is true if it matches reality
                - Requires something more fundamental according to Heidegger
            - [[Alethia]] looks at the concealing notion of revealing a truth, which takes the focus away from another truth, misdirection
