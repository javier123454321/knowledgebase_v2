                        - Gets you pretty far into mastery - at leasts elevates you above being a novice
                    - Spend twice as long on reflection or implementation than on consumption

                        - ### Consuming intellectual content is the least effective method to internalize an idea or concept
                            - When you consume content highlight the words or ideas that come out, then label the ones that seem like they could become a tool
                            - How to consume effectively:
                                - pay attention to the genealogy of ideas, where the author got the idea from
                                    - Watching a movie takes away the entire mental model that you had when reading the book
                                        - Reading an author's interpretation does the same
                                - Collect the quotes which stand out
                        - ### Focus on reflection
                            - Only consuming is just an illusion of mastery and intellectual entertainment.

                                                - You don't have to be an absolute expert before you share
                                                - If I don't share, teach, it might go away
                            - Dificult things weed out the people that don't have what it takes
                                - You can consume difficult things, and get through them, then reward yourself by doing the easier, more lighthearted things
            - You are in a room with a lot of doors, you HAVE to choose one door and go through with it. The beautiful part is that there are infinite doors behind each door.

        - Questions about tools that automate the Web Dev process
            - You are not what you make, you need to change the focus from the what to the why. Being able to achieve something that requires technical capacity is less important as automation increases.
