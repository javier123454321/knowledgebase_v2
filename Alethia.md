- The truth of existence is an uncovering, not the correspondence theory of truth
    - Correspondence theory of truth - (Adequation)
        - Something is true if it matches reality
        - Requires something more fundamental according to Heidegger
    - [[Alethia]] looks at the concealing notion of revealing a truth, which takes the focus away from another truth, misdirection
- An uncovering (literally un-covering) or (dis-covering)
    - [[Alethia]] According to Heidegger
        - Truth is not the actual, fake gold is not "true" gold, but is real anyway.
            - Genuine gold is true gold. True gold is a being that conforms to an idea of what gold should be. 
                - Truth is the correspondence of the matter to knowledge
                    - correspondence of a thing to our understanding of that thing
                    - correspondence of that thing to a proposition of that thing
