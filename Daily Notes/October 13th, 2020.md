- ## [[Quick Capture]]
    - A UNIX shell runs code after the creating a `fork()` but before calling `exec()`, creating the right environment for a program to run. {{[[r/moved]]}}[*](((VQP7r6Usn)))
        - A shell shows a prompt and waits for input
            - It then figures out where the executable resides, and calls `fork()` to create a child process to run the inputted command. 
                - It runs some variant of `exec()` to run the command
                    - It uses `wait()` until the child command finishes.
                    - This allows for chaining

        - [On Good Taste](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE) by Ira Glass
            - There is always a gap between when you start in a creative field between you and your taste.
                - Your taste for good creative work got you into the game, but your ability to produce content that matches that taste is not there yet. 
                    - The ability to tell that you are producing content which is not as good as it could be indicates that it is the right path
                    - Only through going through a whole body of work that you get there eventually.
                - Produce A Lot of content and that will finally get you to fill that gap.
