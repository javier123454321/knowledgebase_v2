- ### EC2 is a full computer on the cloud
    - EVERY other service that amazon has, you can build with EC2.
    - ## Elastic Compute Cloud
    - Secure resizeable compute capacity in the cloud.
    - Compute is the part of the cloud that crunches the data. (a virtualized server)
    - Easy to provision and allow for up/down scaling easily
- ### [[Servers]]
    - A server is a computer that has software to serve data
    - An EC2 instance is you renting a server. Amazon's [[Servers]] are compartamentalized into a bunch of different partitions.
- ### Instance Types
    - Computer needs vary from user to user, gaming, programming, machine learnig.
    - Amazon offers a selection of instance types to give cpu power (or priority access to compute power), Ram, data transfer, etc.
- ### Main Categories
    - CPU
    - Memory
    - Storage
- Instance types are optimized for different use cases.
- EC2 A1 are scaled out for arm based workloads. Arm based have different computer architecture.
- ### T3 instances
    - The most commonly used Higher bandwidth
- ### Compute Optimized (C Instances)
    - Choose processors, size, etc
- ### Accelerated Computing P Inf, G, F
    - [[hardware]] based acceleration
- ### Storage Optimized I, D, H
    - If an application that is not necessarily
    - It boils down to Class, then Size

- Easiest to use, only pay for what you use.
- Allows you to get amazing computer power at your fingerprints, immediately as you need.
- ### Reserving [[Servers]]
    - Aws has a finite capcity of resources. If you are certain of a service and you secure yourself space, and guarantee compute power. Cheaper if you pay up front.
- ### Spot capacity
    - You can bid for server space, low demand times can make prices go down. For example, you can set a price for what you are willing to pay and crunch the numbers for the time capacity is at your threshhold.
- ### Dedicated Hosts
    - If you need the hardware for yourself. No sharing space in a server. Software licensing is sometimes priced per machine, so it makes sense to reduce licensing cost to a single machine.
- ## Storage
    - ### Instance Storage
        - Ephemeral __block__ storage, delete the instance, delete the data.
- ### EBS - Elastic Block Storage
    - Persistent Storage that backs EC2s You can mount multiple EBS volumes to EC2s in the same availability zones.
    - You can only have one EC2 per Storage. You cant connect the storage to multiple computers.
    - Incremental backups - ifyou are paying for an image of 30 Gbs,if the next image is 30+3Gb,you only pay for the extra 3gbs
- ### Security Groups
    - Type | Protocol | Port Range | IP-Range | Notes ssh TCP/UDP 22 0.0.0.0/0 CIDR standard [[NetworkLayer]]
