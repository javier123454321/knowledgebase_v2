    - [[Polygon]]
        - A Layer 2 scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.
        - Send ethereum tokens to a bridge contract which burns tokens which sends an event that instructs to mint them in the polygon chain. It works also backwards, because there can be a proof read in the ethereum blockchain. 
        - There is a sacrifice of one of the three, decentralization, scalability, security.
