Day 5 of polyphasic sleep experiment

Woke up groggy, was fine after an hour or so and got back to being groggy at aroung 5:00 am. I find that I am not able to have long programming sessions, but that might just be because the problem I am looking at right now is a bit annoying and tedious, not just the lack of sleep. 


Sleep Cycle
	**Core - 11:00 pm 1:35 am** Woke up wrecked, felt like a zombie for an hour.
	**N1 - 7:00 - 7:20 am** Awesome short nap super recharging.
	**N2 - 12:20 - 12:40** was an easy to fall asleep, easy to wake up, no dream nap
	**N3 - 5:41 - 6:00 pm** This was the first time in a social setting that I excused myself to go take a nap. Took me a few minutes to go to sleep so only slept a bit over 10 minutes I would say. Woke up feeling great
	Before bed - wound down and got pretty tired at around 10:30. 

Rating great day overall
