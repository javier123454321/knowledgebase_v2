    - Computer as an amplifying of human capability
    - There is a tension between computers amplifying human potential, and computers replacing humans in some capacity.
    - Computer as a bicycle, as studies have shown that humans can vastly amplify their capabilities  by using bicycles and becoming more efficient in energy usage than say a condor.  [[Small is Beautiful]]

            Measure energy for many species to move from point a to b
                - Man as a toolmaker can amplify the human ability.
                - The bicycle can cut energy cost of human locomotion to about 1/5th
                    - (roughly .15 calorie per gram per kilometer)
            
        -  [[Human Scale]] book by [[Kirkpatrick Sale]] focuses on this amplification. 
            - Kirkpatrick is not so optimistic about the computer as Steve Jobs.
    - Ted Koppel warns of the potential for privacy violation, jobs argues of the symmetry, the democratization of computer literacy as an equalizing force. [[Distributed Ontological Frontline]] comes to mind.
