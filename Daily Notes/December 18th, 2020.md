            - The brain doesn't like expending energy for useless things, it forgets
                - This is because evolutionarily, we don't want to keep a bunch of random data in there. 
                - Out of the entirety of the sensory input that we consume, if we were to store all f it, we would not be able to discern and have to wade through much useless info.
            - Sensory input requires attention
                - You cannot absorb the material by putting it on the background
            - With attention, things get put into your short term memory
                - Short term memory is good for about 5 to 7 items
                - To keep the thing in your short term memory, you need rehersal.
            - With attention and rehearsal, information gets **transferred** to long term memory, where it can be **retrieved** in the future
                - To put something in the long term memory, we need to make the brain look at something as important.
                    - Of course, this is because The brain doesn't like expending energy for useless things, it forgets
                - Finally there should be 
            - To label something as important, there needs to be connections with other prior things that we have deemed important [active recall](((FVZ9KQ3u4)))
            - Retrieval practice
                - Watch a video -> take notes -> do a worksheet -> do an experiment -> use it in a real context
                    - All these steps are retrieval practice with the goal of [[activate prior knowledge]]
                        - They, however, need a bit of separation of time
            - To make the information seem important, learning needs to be active
                - [[Experience and Education]] would say, there should be real experiences associated with that learning
            - Finally, learning needs to be communal.
