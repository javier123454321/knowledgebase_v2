- Summary::
    - Habit 3 put first things first
        - Schedule your priorities. When making a schedule, don't just put what you are working on now, your time will get filled by unimportant things, do this work first.
        - This habit is about not being trapped into a sequence of urgent but unimportant tasks.
        - Delegating simple tasks is one way of doing things. Telling people exactly what to do
            - A producer (Individual contributor) gets a 1 to 1 ratio of effort to result. To be more effective, you need to delegate to multiply the effort to result ratio.
        - Stewardships focuses on the what, not how. Results not tasks.
            - Delegation is key to achieving these priorities:
                - Giving people the responsibilities and allow to define the tasks. The key is trust.
                    - How to communicate these:
                        - Desired Results
                        - Guidelines
                        - Resources
                        - Accountability
                        - Consequences
        - [[Leadership - Michael Powel]] talks about the sense of ownership that people need when you delegate tasks to them. It is not enough
            - A leader understands the goals and motivations of the individuals in a group and motivates them towards a goal that seems to the individuals as working towards their own goals.

    - Being effective as a person is not the same as being succesful. Success tends to be unidimensional, while the goal is to be effective in every dimension. Is beig
