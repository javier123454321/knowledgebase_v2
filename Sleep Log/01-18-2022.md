Day 7 of polyphasic sleep experiment. Had a minor mishap in the morning but really had energy all day. Want to start incorporating more exercise into my routine. 

Sleep Cycle
	**Core - 11:00 - 2:10** Had two solid cycles of sleep. Had a guest over so it was kind of awkward being awake because my wife and I were in the living room. Sat down to watch Seinfeld, but on the second episode I fell asleep for about ~10 minutes without realizing it. It just snuck in like that! After it was good and got some work done, reading, and more Seinfeld. 
	**N1 - 7:00 - 7:20** Got woken up by my wife. She put an alarm at 7:10! Can't blame her too much, she's not super used to my scheduled. Stayed in bed for a bit and couldn't get up right away. Meditated at around 8 but it was quite difficult to maintain concentration
	**N2 - 12:20 - 12:40** Seamless, went to sleep fast and woke up 'groggy' for around 20 minutes after waking. Quickly recovered and was back to work.
	**N3 - 5:40 - 6:00**
