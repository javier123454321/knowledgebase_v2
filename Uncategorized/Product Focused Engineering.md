Software development can be categorized with two mentalities. Product vs Engineer mentality. This division marks the difference of a company that advertises what they do vs how they do things. Product focused engineering is much more aligned with the end result, how it connects to the end user, how it benefits people in the end. Engineer mentality focuses on how it solves a problem, how it is a technically superior decision over another one. Which systems are in place to make this into a solid foundation for future technical work.
