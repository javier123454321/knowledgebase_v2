## Abstract
    [[Valorize]].app is an interface for deploying Creator Tokens to the Ethereum Blockchain.
    Creator Tokens are ERC20 tokens which allow creator's fans to invest in the future value generated by that creator. They provide access to special benefits as defined by the creator. They allow fans to vote, to receive investor's only content, and speculate on the future value of a particular individual.
## What problem does valorize solve?
    - As it currently stands, when a person discovers a new content creator and becomes a 'fan', they get little to no value for being a part of the early discovery process of that creator. Valorize allows and encourages early fans to become investors in creators, getting them to the goal of becoming self sufficient full time content generators. Valorize also permits creators to capture value for their content earlier in the lifecycle of the creator economy.
        - As a creator, you are an economic force. You are a coorporation. You can provide value to people directly without middlemen. 
    - Creators are valuable because they have a fanbase which trusts, interacts with, and supports their efforts. Valorize is a mechanisms that allows creators to unlock the potential directly from their fans instead of relying on advertisers to sustain the process. The early fans can generate

## What is a Creator Token
    - Creator Tokens are ERC20 compliant tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. 
    - Creator tokens do not have a fixed supply, rather they get generated as people deposit ETH into the contract. There is an initial supply which is given to the token creator when launching the contract. Each time someone deposits more ETH into the contract, the total number of coins generated are are the square root of the total Ether locked in the contract divided by the current circulating supply of tokens
        - The supply curve for a given token therefore is:
            - $$\sqrt{T/(K\cdot100000000)}$$ 
        - Where $$K = \text{Amount of Coins Previously minted}$$
        - And $$T = \text{Total Wei Locked in the Contract}$$ 
        - (As per the Ethereum Yellow Paper, $$1\text{Eth} = 10^{18} \text{Wei}$$)
            - The supply curve therefore looks like this:

    - The distribution curve follows a logarithmic scale which makes it more difficult to mint new tokens as the value accumulated in the contract grows. This is a technique to incentivize the early adoption individual creators.
    - Locking up coins in the contract itself is a technique common to several Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)and provides liquidity and a guarantee of being able to cash out, without middlemen. The money is secured by the Ethereum blockchain, the largest and most secure network that allows for this type of interaction. Valorize provides an interface to cash out the coins, but it is only the interface. Other interfaces can be built around this open decentralized CreatorToken logic. The valorize contract is simply serving as an automated market maker.
    - Essentially, an automated market maker (AMM) is just a market participant that locks liquidity away guaranteeing that there is always some amount of value that can be redeemed for the tokens that exist currently in circulation. There will always be the ability to cash out, because tokens are only generated when more money is put into the system.

## What are Creator Tokens Useful For
    - The automated market makers are essentially a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAOs) that are governing the tokens that are created by individuals through the valorize interface. Beside their main function of providing liquidity for the tokens that are generated through the app, the DAOs also allow for functionality that can allow for new interactions between creators and their fans. 
    - ### Use Case: Early Finder Reward
        - The first use case that doesn't require any additional functionality from the one stated above is the fact that people are encouraged to find creators early, to encourage them by investing in them, and to grow as the value that they are providing to others also grows. Currently, the economic reality of the creator economy follows an extreme form of a pareto distribution. That is the top 1% handle most of the economic activity of different platforms.

        - The hope is that the ability to invest in up and coming creators to capture their future value will encourage people to look for and support content creators which are not in the top percentile. There will be a market for people that have potential to grow, but have not been discovered yet. Currently, there is no benefit in being an early discoverer of a new creator, with valorize, there is.
    - ### Use Case: **Investors Only Feed**
        - The simplest mechanism that is allowed by the Creator Token DAO is the investors only feed. This is similar to a private feed for subscribers that you would find in a service like patreon or onlyfans. Decentralized access, however, could potentially extend far beyond the confines of the valorize app, and anyone can build their own clients to serve whatever content can be thought of.
    - ### Use Case: **Weighted Voting**
        - Another layer of interaction can be to create a voting mechanism to not only signal what preferences the fans have, but to weigh it in how much fans are already invested in the content the creator is making. Weighted voting systems go far beyond the 1-to-1 ratio of traditional voting. This type of voting provides context, information and verifies that the people signaling for an outcome have skin in the game.
    - ### Use Case: **Crowdsourcing Investment**
        - This is a type of voting which allows users to stake their coins towards a certain outcome. This is much like crowdsourcing today, except that it is handled completely by the code itself. A creator can create projects which users vote for with their tokens. These tokens, will also be locked away for the creator to cash in once a specific milestone has been implemented.
