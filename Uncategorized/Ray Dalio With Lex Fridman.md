Abstract:
Summary:
	Money and power support and compete with each other. Having money gives you power to acquire and to influence political power. This tension has played out with the nobility and the church.
	In the first industrial revolution has machines, hunger for change, and changing power structures but you still see those with money and those with power struggling with each other. 
	Nation States are a new concept
		in 1668 after the 30 years war, nations were formed
	[[The Big Cycle]]
		The Current World Order was defined after WWII, where the countries after the war got together and decided who was the 'leader' -  the US in this case, how the countries will be divided, and you got a period of 'peace' and prosperity
			This cycle repeats itself cyclicly. 
				The Dutch invented capitalism with the first capital markets - allocating resources to inventive people.
					Also were very highly educated and invented ships. Their currency became the reserve currency as they travelled.
					Over a period of time, they become more successful, and more expensive (less competitive). Setting the stage for downturns. The work ethic changes as they assume they can win without as much effort. 
						As you need more money, you need to borrow from other countries, and your status as the global reserve diminishes.
						The problem comes when a downturn happens, and they need money. 
						Income gaps lead to changes in the dynamics. 
		We are borrowing a lot of money, creating a lot of debt  and we only have a limited capacity to do so. 
			When we need money, we make a bond, and there is a limit to how many we can make. When more bonds are sold
		There are quantifiable pieces of data that point to whether a given country is in the state where it is at the risk of a big cycle. 
			The cycle happens to all global reserve powers and dynasties. The data shows that we are close to repeating this cycle again with the US and China. 
			Education is one of the most important metrics for how well a society is functioning. It is one of the most instructive trailing factors. 
				You don't know where the next great mind will come from, so you must cast a wide net 
					[Buckminster Fuller](Buckminster%20Fuller.md) often talks about the fact that you only need 1 person to discover a principle which can sustain the rest of humanity. ^solving-problems-bucky
				There are productive and destructive conflicts, a short term civil war can lead to a new organizational structure for mankind. Violence can often lead to a destructive cycle
		The US is loosing it's educational advantage.
			General public education has deteriorated in comparison with developed countries.
			The US however, is unique in having the best universities in the world.
			Education in China is increasing in quality at the same time, resources, and outcomes are improving. 
				They are competitive in the world stage and it is good for the world if they do not cause political turmoil
			The US is indicating itself to be tumbling. Due to circumstances like debt, it is hard to manage.
