        - Color is the way that we see light interacting with objects.
        - The Sun is the largest source of light in the world
            - When all the types of visible light are combined they produce white light
                - Red Orange Yellow Green Cyan Blue and Violet in that order from Shorter to longer [*]([[hue]] {{[[∆]]:3+2}}) {{[[r/moved]]}}[*](Red Orange Yellow Green Cyan Blue and Violet in that order from Shorter to longer [*]([[hue]] {{[[∆]]:3+2}}) {{[[r/moved]]}} {{[[∆]]:1+2}}) {{[[r/moved]]}}
        - As light is absorbed and reflected, it is perceived as a color
            - Each color is every other colored absorbed and the color that we are looking  at reflected to us
        - Different mediums reflect light differently
            - Screens vs Glossy paper
    - [[Seeing the World through Color]]
        - As we see the world, we see a multitude of colors Each primary color has a spectrum depending on lightness, saturation
            - i.e. rose, fuschia
        - Each color has a multitude of parameters that define the color
            - [[hue]][*]([[hue]] {{[[∆]]:3+2}}) {{[[r/moved]]}}
                - The color (without extra properties like lightness or saturation) that gets reflected to us
                - There are hundreds of hues
                - HSV **H**ue **S**aturation **V**alue
                - HSL **H**ue **S**aturation **L**ightness
            - [[saturation]][*](((7nGWY47_K))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
            - [[HSV value]][*](((nU2MXnk-A))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
            - [[brightness]] or lightness[*](((0nX9VGp62))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
        - Each can be adjusted to produce a grid of different colors
            - [[color contrast]][*](((xZYv0IZGs))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
                - To check the contrast it can be useful to put everything in greys and see if you can tell the difference.
                - Low contrast can be a stylistic choice, but it looses information
    - [[Color Mixing]]
        - For digital and print media we use light
        - Our eyes use cones to decrypt light information in our retina
            - We use the RGB colors and mix them together to form all the other colors
        - Blue light absorbs all other colors and reflects blue wavelengths back to us
            - Blue and red combine to create a magenta color
                - Your brain is creating the illusion of magenta by combining what it sees in red and blue receptors
                - if you put a lot of red and blue dots side by side your brain interprets magenta
                - Your monitor only sends out red green and blue dots, and places them close together to get what looks like every color in the color wheel
