- Abstract::
- Summary::
    - Thiel introduces the thesis that progress is good, and it can solve almost all problems in society. The issue is that we have no manner of meaningfully measuring progress. 
        - Where there is significant progress in computation and information technology, the world of atoms is adapting quite slowly. 
            - We tell people to join stem because it is where the jobs are but there are in fact fewer and fewer jobs for researchers in math, physics, chemistry, etc.
                - A student might be better off doing a degree in the humanities rather than the sciences because at least in the humanities you know there will be no degree waiting for you at the end while in the science you will be deluded that you will be taken care of by the goodness of the universe.
            - The thesis that progress is happening at an unprecedented pace is wrong, and if you operate under the assumption that it is correct, the secondary problems are more important. Inclusion, etc becomes more important than making more progress (which is fundamentally good)
        - When we ask the question of how much progress has been achieved, we use the inflation metrics which indicate that the pace of advancement is so much that it justifies the rate at which the circulation of money goes. People have the incentives to exagerate their progress and there is the case that there should be a more scientific measurement.
            - Our current system works if it is not zero sum. It necessitates these breakthrough in progress through the economy, otherwise, you land in a position of taking something in order to succeed, which seeds resentment and is not stable.
        - There are utopian and dystopian arguments that there is much progress happening (silicon valley techno utopianism vs cyberpunk techno distopianism)
    - On the question of public goods
        - Why does the ny subway system not work?
            - Unions corruption technology?
    - On the question of automation
        - Being forced to reinvent yourself on a constant basis is scary for the regular person.
