Day 4 of polyphasic sleep experiment

Woke up and had a hard time staying awake. Got energy after about an hour and was pretty evenly energied out until about 20 minutes before my first nap. Worked on coding throughout most of the early morning shift, but was not as focused as I would have wished to be. I also experienced hunger throughout the whole night shift. 
I ate a lot during the morning.
Started getting pretty tired during around 10:30 pm

Sleep Cycle
	**Core - 11:00 pm - 2:00 am** Slept three sleep cycles according to the app. 
	**N1 - 7:00 - 7:20?** Kind of overslept, Maybe? At this point not sure if I did, I definitely stayed in bed for a bit, don't feel great about it
	**N2 - 12:20 - 12:40** Was super easy to fall asleep and wake up, feel really rested
	**N3 - 5:41 - 6:00pm** Felt like I might have not gotten any sleep. Feel groggy coming out of it, felt fine going into it.
