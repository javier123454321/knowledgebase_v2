            - One big boockase which doubles as seating, wallspace, and creating form
            - Taking advantage of the fact that shelves have a topological nature to them
                - A lot of spaces that use this topological approach seem to be just decoration, this is playful and useful
            - Criticism:
                - How much of the space gets wasted in this approach? Volumetric moves like this, carving out portions of the space are beautiful but does it leave A LOT of unused space?
