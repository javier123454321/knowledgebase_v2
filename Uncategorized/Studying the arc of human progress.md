- Summary::
    - Jason Crawford has a blog that is dedicated to the new field of [[progress studies]] which is a field of research that is rooted on the assumption that progress is good, and requires attention and nurture. i.e. it is not a given that progress will happen. 

(His site)[https://rootsofprogress.org/] is a source that tracks down the most significant inventions and how they came to be, a historical, interdisciplinary, opinionated approach to looking at history. His historiography is opinionated, as it should be, and he deals with the task of popularizing the content, not producing new academic research. 
    - taking full control of your life and following a path that you are interested in. finding the question or problem which will motivate you into the future.
        - His story is inspiring, as he pursued what was driving him, and abandoned a role as a startup founder to get there. His grit is also commendable from his telling. On a personal level, he is an Objectivist in the Randian sense, which has its limitations, but you can see the naive approach paying dividends in his ambition.
    - Finding the foundation of your belief structure and diving into it fully. Better health, technology, quality of life, life expectancy, new innovation are good things. This is a moral position.
        - His self awareness is refreshing, although his premise might not be fully valid.
