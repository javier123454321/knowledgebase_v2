# Software Development Life Cycle

the process for planning creating testing and dplowing an information system.

## Requirement Analysis
Can be lacking in many projects.

- **Determine user expectations** for a new or modified products
	(If it doesn't solve a problem, software is useless)
- **Feasibility study** is it legal, technically, feasibility. Planning is not necessarily a technical questions.
- **Requirements Gathering**
- **Software Specification** Mobile friendly, web browser
- **Negotiation and Discussion**
- **Documentation** User Journeys, product roadmaps

## Design
Can come before the requirement analysis

### Software Design is the process of defining software solutions to one or more sets of problems
Software Architecture is part of it, design is not just graphic. User flow, ease of use, where, why, how.

## Development
The writing of the code that will solve the problem we are trying to solve

## Testing
How we know the software is doing the intended thing (not that it is correct)
- **Unit** that a single unit of code does what it is supposed to
- **Integration** That code works together
- **E2E** that the application workflow is going

## Implementation/Deployment
Get the product in the user's hands

Collect the metrics

## Documentation
App Usage
Software
Architecture
Processes

No one does it well...	

## Evaluation
Does the thing work...
