- [[Quick Capture]]
    - Thoughts on launching a startup
        - Your product needs to be 10x better, 10x cheaper, or 10x easier than a competitor
            - Otherwise, you don't stand a chance at standing out.
        - Questions that I will ask myself about my next startup
            - Do I see myself happily working on this problem for the next 10 years
                - A huge issue that I see with Memory Captures, is that I am simply uninterested in the problem we are solving. I do not necessarily want to be a leader in this space
                - If not, does the thing have a deadline after which the work to maintain the thing drops off 10x OR will it give me the leverage
            - Am I currently able to do the thing, or learn quickly enough to do the thing?
        - I will talk to the people that will use, pay for the thing that I am looking to do before putting in more than 2 weeks of work.

    - [[What did I learn]]
        - John Deweys theory of continuity of experience. Taking advantage of the present moment and learning from it will allow you to learn from the present moment in the future. So many similarities with buddhist thought here. There seems to be a correlation between good ideas and buddhist ideas, that is much deeper. 
Karma - we are completely responsible for our future
Impermanence - Nothing lasts forever
Boddhichita - We already have everything that we need to be happy
Emptiness - because everything is constantly changing, and we are in control of our future, everything is possible.
    - [[What went well?]]
        - The conversation after the public meditation. Lots of questions and talking. So happy that we can share this public meditation with the people that are looking for some lasting values during the pandemic. Clarity about what I want to do with Memory Captures.
    - [[What could be better?]]
        - Spend time with loved ones. Didn't kiss Zselyke today until midnight.
