- Abstract::
    - The concept of the book is an attempt to answer the question of why is it that after the fall of the soviet union and its influence in poland, the people that were most able to quickly adapt to the new Liberal Democratic State were the hardcore communists. Logically, if these two systems were so opposed to one another, you would expect a divergence between the two camps, but it tuns out the opposite was true. What is at the root of this?
- Summary::
    - 1. Introduction
        - That there seems to be a disturbing tendency towards [[communism]] in liberal democracy. Whereas this might be taken as a fluke, there might be some more fundamental underlying reason to be the case. If you dig into the roots of [[communism]] and liberal democracy, you find the idea of a modernization underpinning their foundations. Modernization is a one sided path towards a more ideal future, and both of these systems look to be under the assumption that they are at the pinnacle of history.
            - This is EXTREMELY explicit in Marx's theory of the science of dialectical materialism. Marx even points to the inevitability of material forces locked into a constant struggle for dominance in society. Liberal Democracy is not as clear to me from its foundations whether it is the case that there is a certain inevitability to it, but it might be my lack of knowledge in the topic.
        - This drive towards the ultimate state of history leads to a few outcomes, one obvious being that an attack on the foundations of your system means an attack t the idea of perfection. Criticizing [[communism]] or liberal democracy would mean critizising the future prosperity and benefits of this potential and should therefore be stopped. 
            - Totalitarian and absolute concepts are dangerous because of this. [[communism]] is an epitome of this example.
    - 2. History
        - [[communism]] on History
            - Communism has a view of history that posits communism not as a possibility but an inevitability. This concept was hailed by Engels in a speech given at Marx's funeral that says that like Darwin discovered the laws of nature, so had Marx discovered the laws of history. [[Karl Popper]] then argued that history did not fall into the purview of an object of scientific inquiry (based on his [[falsifiability principle]]) so this is not only logically faulty, but presented a danger towards totalitarianism and political violence.
            - Te second point is that those that are most aware of the historical road to communism will be the ones that will bring it forward. Of course the proletariat, but also the intellectual class and the students during the revolution
            - The third point is about the very abstract idea that the history and process of humanity was towards full self consciousness as described by German metaphysics
        - Liberalism on History
            - Liberalism does not have a singular point that converges into a person responsible for the ideas espoused within it, but it does have a bent towards liberty and its struggle with authority.
                - Whereas communism spoke about the end of alienation, the recuperation of labor time and leisure within society at the victory of the proletariat over the bourgeoisie, liberalism's future - when freedoms trumps over authority - was one of a peaceful cooperation between warring countries over fair markets.
                - Liberalism also depended on the growth of the individuals within its structure, a tendency towards enlightened absolutism to achieve its outcome. A self actualization like the one of communism and requires a growth of the individuals to achieve its inevitable conclusion. 
		Max Weber moved capitalism to be something more like a religious experience through working.  
			The protestant ethic is a manifestation of a man's search for meaning with his discipline or his endeavors  
			Likewise there was separation from entertainment with work. The thing is to have discipline work, work as a reward for itself  
			Weber actually separated what man could achieve in The Godly realms with what he could achieve in the Earthly realms. The Protestant idea of man as unworthy leads to the search of meaning and worth through their work. Human creativity was really only expressed through work  
			With secularization a new tendency arose we're because man couldn't achieve the high aspirations of the past and without a religious reason for it then what is left is pure crass entertainment  
		Entertainment is described as that which turns us away from our heavenly aspirations. Things that distract us from our goals. Things that we do to escape finding meaning in our lives what pascal calls divertissement.  
		Entertainment is everywhere every were surrounding is that every in our life distracting as a way for the questions about our existence liberalism embraced entertainment as the ultimate Freedom Movement  
		  
		Liberalism was able to shape a system that was strongly correlated and molded after the aspirations of the people that live inside of it  
		There was in Poland the initial free inject some Christian intellectual values the communist regime. The protest Valley is actually continue on the protest of 89 when communism left account. Poland and instead took a sort of approach in which it took the liberal West that's the new guideposts the inevitability of History moves away from communism which was obvious at the time be the future of the world to liberalism and pulling was forced these ideas with a kind of knowledge that they are behind on the historical line of progress that mostly nearly towards the end of History according to both  
  3. Utopia
	Because socialism communism and liberalism see themselves as the ultimate expression of human organization an attack on the political structure is actually an attack on the progress of humanity itself  
		They are both seen as the final realization of the goals and desires of mankind  
		Communism talk about it as the victory of the proletariat who have been oppressed bourgeoisie. Liberalism season as the Triumph of democracy over totalitarianism and fascism  
		Any attack on either of them is immoral  
	Liberalism actually becomes a synonym with good in the language that is used to describe it  
	Utopianism was often accompanied with a with a caveat that the implementation would be extremely difficult and likely not resemble the idea in practice  
		Utopias actually appeared in the Renaissance when believe in men's cognitive and rational capacities were at the highest in history  
	Marx actually shuns the idea of utopia because a good idea is not enough. A transformative idea should happen deep exploration and investigation of the laws that govern human interactions  
		The irony is that it was his utopian Vision not a scientific analysis that made communism so popular.  
	Liberalism likewise had a utopian character if you look at the american libertarian concept of liberalism the completely free market without any intervention that would creep the fairest possible outcome for all parties involved

	Churchill is often quoted as saying 
		"No one pretends that **democracy** is perfect or all-wise. Indeed it has been said that **democracy** is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.…’" 
		and that is taken as a positive take on the democratic process, however it definitely has a pointed criticism in there. 
		Democracy is said to be the ultimate solution, and often the solutions put forth for solving its problems is more democracy.
			You cannot solve the problems of democracy with more democracy.
				In our society, democracy is seen as an a priori good.
			You would never put that as a solution to the problem of communism
		The greeks were quick to bring up the problems of democracy. In his discussions with Aristotle, Plato talks about democracy and points its obvious flaws, mob rule and chaotic organizations. 
			In their discussions, they mix the most known methods of the time
				Rule of 1 - Monarchy
				Rule of few - Aristocracy
				Rule of Many - Democracy
			This is the basis to form a republic. Where each of these systems are studied as though they have tradeoffs, no one is inherently better than the others.
		In liberal democracies, being seen as anti-democratic is a-priori bad. Yet we take it as known that there are tradeoffs, it is after all, the worst form of government.
			Being anti-democratic should not be immediately seen as a horrible thing. There should be a way to criticize it.
	Liberal democracies are the democratization of liberalism, elements became divergent. 
		The liberal democracy was meant to be egalitarian. Liberalism was built in some notions that were allowed to grow out of hand. 
			See the EU and the Federal government.
				People trust the institutions less and less, but expect more and more.

    - Similarly, according to its followers can arise in the wake of liberal democracy, which, per a common though rarely explicitly articulated conviction, exhausted the process of political transformations.  if there is such an ability to hypothesize possible political arrangements, this cannot lead us, in the first case, beyond communism, or in the second, beyond liberal democracy.
