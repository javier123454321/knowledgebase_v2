            - Computer science is the wrong term for the field
                - It is more software engineering, but that has a lot of baggage
                - Could be called complexity engineering
            - The more people that you put in a project, the longer the project takes
            - Programming paradigms
                - How we organize or think of programs
            - Layers of abstraction
                - Application

            - Functions
                - They are standard, same inputs are always yielding same outputs
                - Important because computers do things at the same time thanks to [multi threading](((VHim9Pnti)))
                - If the function depends on the output of the other to work there are issues. So you want certainty that every function ALWAYS returns the same answer.
                    - Functional programming protects you from having to know what is happening inside the computer.
            - Functions vs Procedures
                - Functions always have the same outbput
                - so 
$$f(x) = 2x + 6$$ and 
$$g(x)= 2(x + 3)$$
                    - These are the same function.
                    - They are however different procedures.

            - There is a wall in our brains that separates data and procedures
            - That's why language tends to separate nouns and verbs
                - Calculus is difficult because the integral is a function of functions
                - $$\int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx = \frac{x^3}{3} + c$$
                    - It takes a function and returns other functions
            - functions are data in the computer science model.
