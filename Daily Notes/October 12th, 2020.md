    - [[[Article]]](https://medium.com/sfi-30-foundations-frontiers/emergence-a-unifying-theme-for-21st-century-science-4324ac0f951e) by David Pines of the Santa Fe Institute in my saved reddit feed from 5 years ago. 
        - Unifying a theory of complexity is impossible as everything seems to be a non linear system.
            - A theory of non-linear phenomena is like a theory of non-cow phenomena, too broad to be a useful category. 
        - trying to find a unified "Theory of "Everything" has tended to be reductionistic and focused on smaller and smaller units of observation - uncapable of describing emergent complexity
            - behaviors that govern our world do nothing to describe emergent behavior
                - Complex science can focus on emergent behaviors as the basic unit of measurement 
                    - **__gateways to emergent behavior__**
                        - focus on describing the emergent relationships that appear in complex behavior through observation or experimentation
                        - Decide the most important interactions between observed entities
                        - Make a model using those connections and that describes the emergent behavior (take inspirations from models for this in different fields)
                        - Test your predictions through observation/experimentation 
        - [[Complexity: A Guided Tour]]
        - Is complexity a new focus? what kind of prospects does this methodology afford?
            - Seems like the only way to study urban systems which makes sense.
    - People are leaving California
        - [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYUDZGwUzXE
        - Seems that these cities are at an exodus moment. When rising property taxes, caps on affordable housing, and red tape beurocracy are stopping it from becoming a livable situation.
        - Highest sales tax, 13.3 percent
        - Seems that Cali is attracting many homeless, and it looks like it  is kind of left to be there. 
        - Each unit is required to have a parking unit, an open common area attached to it. That isn't conducive to low income housing units, so prices tend to be inflated to account for the discrepancy
            - Regulation is driving up the price [[market urbanism]] seems like an appropriate solution in this point.

        - People are presented a problem when they try to use a computer to create a solution. We are introducing a problem between us and their problem.
            - [[Heidegger]]'s use of tools
                - The argument stems from [[Heidegger]]’s analysis of the term sometimes called ‘Handiness’ which looks at the way that Dasein or a being that is aware of its existence functions in a world which always already exists before we can analyse it. The utility of things is not tied to our analytical understanding of how they work. Tools recede from our experience when they perform their function properly, they are a means-to something, and that something is what receives our attention. It is not until the tool stops functioning that our analytic/theoretical understanding of the tool comes into our experience of using that tool.
        - Apple aimed to reduce the need to know anything about the computer to use it to solve a problem
    -  [[specialization]] is way less interesting than being a [[generalist]]. I think there is a misdirected focus towards [[specialization]] and narrowing down in today society when reality the level of [complexity]([[Complexity]]) required to attack our largest problems i. E. Global warming, overpopulation, space exploration, educational reform, race relations, etc. all these domains require a broad and total approach not a highly narrow down over specialized approach.
    - **[[Web Accessibility]] conversation with Will Delphia**
        - The web is beggining to mature into an industry with well established standards since its 25 years of common practice. While the Hypoccratic oath has been around 100 times longer.
            - Accessibility should not feel like a hacky afterthought, but an inherent feature where the 'correct' approach is not laborious but feels more embedded.
        - Is the market inherently ableist, with little incentives to create an accessible web interface
            - Litigation definitely sped up the pace of innovation in the field of web accessibility,

            - Reference > Literature > Permanent > block outlines
                - Reference notes are refs to different subjects
                - Literature are your own words and thoughts about the reference
                - Permanent notes are your idea about that subject
                    - This allows you to quickly find out your notes about any topic you've seen in the past. 
    - conversation between Lex Friedman and Paul Krugman
        - paul follows John Rawls in his assessment that people should be able to live in a society that people would select behind a [[veil of ignorance]]
        - his biggest criticism about a free market is that there is a large formation asymmetry between providers of a service as complex as Healthcare.
            - I mean he's trying to come off as a rational person that's doing evidence-based approaches towards what the government should regulate and what it shouldn't
                -  he goes against privatizing public education but against nationalizing steel production industry
        - I tend to go back to my notion that striving towards an ideal that is never going to be atained might be incorrect way to proceed.
            - Indian she definitely is pushing for an evidence-based approach to economics which for the most part I agree with him on that in general. the problem of course is that a kannamma Cooks it's not an evidence-based science but a philosophical eBay science that tries to create models that corresponds was a very cartoonish version of reality
                - conservatives tend to be against any type of government program that it that is increasing government spending because they see it as the beginning of the wedge of increased government spending in many different domains
                    - claims to pretty unequivocal literature that since asked that raising the minimum wage to $12 per hour would be economically beneficial and would not have any particularly negative effects on jobs right the upper end of the racing of the minimum wage is where the problematic starts starts to be less defined
- # [[Literature Notes]]
    - The science of emergent behavior is interesting, as it necessitates an origin from the point of interconnectedness at the largest of scales. 
        - Given that a system can exhibit behavior unable to be described by its individual parts - the definition of complexity - we would need to start our investigation on the emergent phenomenon at the largest observable scale. 
            - This immediatlely  leads to questions of observability, given our situation as human subjects in the world. What is the largest observable system that we are a part of?
