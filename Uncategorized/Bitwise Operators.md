Can be tricky and unintuitive
Bitwise operators are a kind of fragment left over from the computation of the 70s which was expensive.
Every operation eventually gets abstracted away from the core metal operation of zeroes and ones.
Circuits allow a current to start and stop, which can be represented by two states: 0 and 1
transistors can be laid out in a logic board basically turn it into a logic gate
## AND and OR gate

### AND gate
1010
1100
equals:
1000

### OR gate:
1010
1100
equals:
1110

[[Binary Notation]]
1 = 00000001
2 = 00000010
3 = 00000011
4 = 00000100 

Javascript can do bitwise or `|`
console.log(1 | 2) ==  
00000001 
00000010
