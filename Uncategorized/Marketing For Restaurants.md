With social media increasing our reach to heights that have been unprecedented in our history, a new industry of social media companies has surged. To many of us, social media is a nice to have, which is the wrong strategy to use. It is a huge mistake to miss out on a massive tool for getting your brand out there.

Here are some tips to use social media more effectively. 
## Be Deliberate
    - Hopefully you know about Hashtags. Hashtags are extremely effective, because of their network effects. What you can do to maximize these effects, is research what your clients are posting. Client research is crucial, and you can gain so much from understanding where your potential clientele is spending their time. 
    - An excellent way to get to where your clients are, is to make an effort to understand them. A simple way to boost your reach is to put out content in your city. You also have to make sure you contextualize your posts. Halloween for example is a massively instagrammable event. Finally, if something is happening in your city, like your baseball team just won a game, make that trending hashtag guide people to your page by posting content with it.
    - In the end, it's about being part of a conversation that people are already having.
## Give for Free
    - In his book 'Give For Free', Chris Anderson explains the new business model that has been surging due to the means of production afforded by the internet. The premise is simple, give and you shall receive. The more value you give to others, the more that they are likely to gain something back.
    - A great strategy that Gary Vee sugests is to contact people in your area. Find, for example, someone in say Wriggleyville that looks like your ideal customer and send them a message on instagram saying something simple like: "Hey, see you are here in Wriggley, so are we, we appreciate the love you put for our neighborhood and would love to give you a $20 voucher to come check us out." That is it, don't ask them to tag you, to tell their friend, or whatever like that. Give without the expectation of return. Likewise, as a restaurant owner, you know that if a person comes to your restaurant 3 times, there is an over 70%chance of them returning a 4th time. So you can find people that have been to your restaurant, or that tagged you and do the same. 
    - People today have a massive voice, and their recommendation means a lot to their friends and loved ones. Word of mouth is the most effective way to advertise and cannot be done if it is disengenious, build rapport first. Do this to build a relationship, not to get free advertisement, and they will become an amazing advocate for your brand.

## [[Content Quantity]] [[marketing]]
    - There is a paradox in every creative field like marketing, where you want to produce good quality content, but don't know how to do so. You might even try to do something, then think that it looks bad and want to remove it. We would encourage you to keep going, to keep trying things out and to produce a large body of work that will allow you to determine what works. 

You basically cannot figure out what works unless you try things out. Your first posts might perform poorly, and that is great news, because now you have an indicator of something that can be tweaked and compared to. If you commit to AT LEAST 1 post per week, but you should be aiming for once a day, you have a lot of room to experiment. Also, posting on instagram is not the only way to go about it, take advantage of snapchat stories, instagram reels, sliding posts, facebook groups, and tik-tok. Yes, tik-tok is a great platform that has a massive reach today. 

Quantity of posts allow you to define what is quality. So the key to achieving great results is to create a system of accountability, like a schedule, that you will commit to. Only through this process will you get to a point where you will know what works and what doesn't.

            - There is always a gap between when you start in a creative field between you and your taste.
                - Your taste for good creative work got you into the game, but your ability to produce content that matches that taste is not there yet. 
                    - The ability to tell that you are producing content which is not as good as it could be indicates that it is the right path
                    - Only through going through a whole body of work that you get there eventually.
                - Produce A Lot of content and that will finally get you to fill that gap.
Have Fun
    - Social media is a place where people go to take a break. If you have fun and are making it fun for them, they will ultimately connect with you. Keep this in mind as you go on in your journey. Good luck!
