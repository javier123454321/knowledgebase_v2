Uses HTTP to encode HTML (which can be static) 

- Apache is tried and true
- NGINX is pretty good also
- Apache Tomcat is designed to run with the JVM

Apache is good for dynamic content and NGINX is good for static

### Ports

Port is a logical gate or connection. It is the way that a client program specifies a specific server program on a computer in a network.

Only one program can be working on a single port at one time. 

- A numbered endpoint
