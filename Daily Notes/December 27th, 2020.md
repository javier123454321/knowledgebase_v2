        - Conversation with Michael about communities in learning
            - Learning is a social structure
                - In a campus, the essential difference to e-learning is the basic infrastructure of learning
                - Learning is being disciplined, listening to your teacher, talking to your peers, all this is the structure of learning.
                - The pressure of exams that still makes learning work in the university
                    - The pressure is external in university
            - Your identity is part of the learning process, you "are" a student when you go to university
                - There are facebook groups that are set up to talk bad about the professors
            - Apprenticeship is based in a comminity and a person that is to become a participant to that community. The way that the learner is positioned within the community allows you to become part of the community
                - To become a Tailor
                    - stitches, cutting, etc, (task structure)
                    - To make a jacket you need x,y,z... etch. It was believed that the task structure is how students learn.
                        - Students are given very hard tasks at the beggining to make them fail (a social structure instead of a task structures)
                        - We don't learn sequentially in environments of learning. We learn based on how others are doing the thing.
                            - Connecting to the network of practicioners. Seeing how others work to make sense - your position withing the community.
                                - Jane Lave - a community that knows how to work together, an outside person then stands outside the community to try to go in.
                                - Community is the basic structure of learning.
                                    - It is about positioning yourself within the community.
                                    - Not about aquiring knowledge but in redefining your relationship within the community.
                                        - You don't do stitches, cutting, etc, (task structure)
                                            - You move up in the hierarchy of  the learning community
            - Having access to the finished product. (Why you are doing the thing  and how it fits to the big picture)
