    - Building vs City
        - ### Distinctions
            - What is a building?
            - What is not a building?
            - How would you distinguish between a building and a city?
            - Can you compare and contrast a building and a city?
        - ### Systems
            - What are the parts of a building?
            - What is a building a part of?
            - Can you name some parts of the parts of a building?
            - What are the parts of the relationship between a building and a city
            - What are the parts of a building when looked at from the viewpoint of a city?
        - ### Relationships
            - What ideas are related to a building and what ideas are related by a city?
            - What idea relates a building and a city?
            - How are the parts of a building related?
            - How are the parts of a building related to a city?
            - What are the relationships among a building and a city and other things?
        - ### Perspectives
            - When looking at a building, can you identify the perspective it is viewed from, and the subparts of that perspective?
            - Can you think of a building from multiple perspectives?
            - How are a building and a city related when looking at them from a new perspective?
            - What are the parts of a building when looked at from multiple perspectives?
- ## Some Advanced DSRP Questions
    - Remember that a **Distinction** is made up of an **__identity__** (what something is) and an **__other__** (what something is not). To perform a Distinction analysis, take a step back from your map and ask yourself these questions:
        - Are these all the identities that you need? Is there something important missing?
        - Are any of your identities overlapping or redundant?
        - Do your identities represent specific constructs? Could you add language to make them more distinct?
        - Do any of your identities cause you to marginalize or overlook other identities?
        - For each identity you make ask yourself, "What is the cognitive opportunity cost?" Am I okay with that cost?
        - How does analyzing or deconstructing what-some-thing-(identity)-is-not, help you to define the boundary of what it is?
        - Do any of your explicit identities communicate implicit bias?
        - Should you articulate the assumptions (i.e., perspectives) that underlie your choice of language/distinctions?
        - Are my distinctions MECE/NONG (Mutually Exclusive Collectively Exhaustive / No Overlaps, No Gaps)?
        - Are my distinctions necessary/sufficient?
        - From what perspective (set of assumptions) am I making my initial distinctions?
        - Am I othering (Creating a marginalized other)? Could things be distinguished differently
    - Remember that a **System** is made up of an interaction between **__part__** and **__whole__**. To perform a part-whole analysis, take a step back from your map and ask yourself these questions:
        - Would my analysis benefit from turning any distinction into a whole and considering its parts?
        - Are there parts missing in any of my existing wholes?
        - Have I considered how the parts are related?
        - Should I zoom into any part and deconstruct it further into parts of its own? (i.e., make a part a whole)
        - Do the parts look different from different perspectives? (e.g., named differently, seen or not seen)
        - Does the existence of parts in one whole indicate a certain part should be included in another whole?
        - Are there parts that should be a perspective on some part of my map?
        - Would laying out the parts differently (left, right justified or freehand) make my map easier to read?
        - How are things organized into part-whole groupings/systems?
        - From what perspective are my groupings being made? Could things be organized differently? Am I locked into categorical thinking?
    - Remember that a **Relationship** is made up of an **__action__** and a **__reaction__**. To perform a Relationship analysis, take a step back from your map and ask yourself these questions:
        - Are these all the relationships that I need? Are there relationships missing?
        - Should any of my relationships be directional (arrows)?
        - Should I identify/distinguish any of the relationships? (i.e., give them a block and a name)
        - Should I zoom into any of these relationship-distinctions and consider their parts? (i.e., create an RDS)
        - Do the relationships look different from different perspectives? (e.g., named differently, seen or not seen)
        - Are there relationships between relationships?
        - Are there systems of relationships? (e.g., short or long feedback loops)
        - Are there relationships between the parts of 2 or more systems? (i.e., an R-channel)?
        - Would laying out the Ds and Rs differently (moving things around) make my map easier to read?
        - Have the parts of systems and subsystems been sufficiently related?
        - Do any of the current relationships need to be distinguished? Systematized? (RDS)
    - Remember that **Perspectives** are made up of an interaction between **__point__** and **__view__**. To perform a Perspective analysis, take a step back from your map and ask yourself these questions:
        - Do the distinctions, relationships, or part-whole organization of my map reveal an implicit perspective (i.e., bias, assumptions, root perspective, etc.)
        - Would my analysis benefit from adding a perspective(s) or turning any distinction into a point of view?
        - Are there /missing/important perspectives that would provide insight?
        - Have I looked at the alternatives to the perspectives I have included?
        - Should I zoom into any perspective and think of it as being made up of parts which are sub-perspectives? (i.e., many perspectives are not homogenous)
        - Do the distinctions, relationships, part-whole organization or perspectives taken look different from a different perspective?
        - If I took a moment to look at the entire map from the perspective of each node in the map, does it reveal hidden and important complexities?
        - Would laying out the parts differently (left, right justified or freehand) make my map easier to read?
        - What perspective is the whole system from? Am I okay with that?
        - Is there anything in the system analysis that should be a perspective on the whole?
        - Are all of my perspectives “with eyes”? What about conceptual or other non-living perspectives?
