        - Abstract::
        - Summary::
            - Complexity is the effort required to understand what the system is doing.
            - Go was designed while waiting for a C++ program to compile
            - Naming
                - The closer the variable declaration to its use, the shorter the variable name is.
                    - Lengthy names can be more confusing
                    - The compiler removes the need to name the variable type. 
                    - usersMap can just be users
                    - for function parameters
                        - ```javascript
func do(config *Config)
// can be reduced to just c (or conf if it is a longer method)```
