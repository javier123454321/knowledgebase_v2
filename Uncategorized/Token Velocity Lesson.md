Title: Token Velocity Lesson
---
## # Research
-   all token pitches include a line that goes something like this: “There is a fixed supply of tokens. As demand for the token increases, so must the price.”
-   Most utility tokens don’t provide a compelling reason for token holders to hold the token for more than a few seconds. Absent speculation, assets with high velocity will struggle to maintain long-term price appreciation.

# Notes

-   Tokens are usually something like this:

	-   Blockchain based service 
	-   Have our own (Utility) Token
	-   To use our service you must pay with our native token
  $$M \cdot (\downarrow V)= P \cdot Q$$
  If the project reaches a constant economic output and has a fixed money supply, the equation begins to look like:
  $$\overline{M} \cdot (\uparrow V)= P \cdot \overline{Q}$$
  The only way to counterbalance it is to raise the prices of the good - **Measured in tokens**$$\overline{M} \cdot (\uparrow V)= (\uparrow P) \cdot \overline{Q}$$
