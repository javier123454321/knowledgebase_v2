Abstract:
Summary:
	**Section 1 - Bitcoin is not a computer, it is money**
		Bitcoin's main invention is the concept of using Proof of Work, which is really just a mechanism for ordering transactions in plausibly verifiable way within an adversarial system. The value of the currency created by the network is also endogenous and necessary for the system itself. Without it, the incentive to protect the network is not there. This is different than most previous forms of digital cash that were implemented earlier. Previous attempts were not creating their own currency, rather working as IOUs for other currencies or financial instruments.

		Bitcoin is not a computer, but a ledger. It uses computers as a way to precisely secure the layer through the Proof of Work algorithm, but that is not a necessary condition for the system. Bitcoin would work with only pen and paper and carrier pigeons, as what it is is a ledger. 
		Likewise, Bitcoin is not an inneficient database, at is only an append only ledger. The fact that computers run it is not core to Bitcoin itself, just a coincidental fact due to the effiency gains of running Bitcoin via computers and through communication infrastructure. It's not an inneficient database, just as much as a car isn't an inefficient stove.

	**Section 2 - Crypto is not Decentralized**
		The steelman argument for DeFi is the promise that it has the ability to reduce the barrier to entry for financial instruments down to zero. It also gives users cryptographic guarantees that they are the exclusive owners of the data that they are using to interact with these applications. 
		The built in monetary aspect of these currencies fundamentally alter the dynamic of import/export of data. Users will demand exporting because these are their financial assets. Allowing for external data to be imported comes with built in financial incentives, as the data has value already.
		Does it need a token, though?
		That is at the core of what we are trying to find out. These systems don't work without an endogenous unit that represents some value to participants outside of the system. However, these systems are creating things which are not exclusively money, and will therefore fight money for liquidity. You can compare them to Disney Bucks, or casino chips, you don't keep those, as money is a much better thing to keep, with higher liquidity. Projects do things to incentivize holding on to the token, such as providing yield, or things like liquidity, but will always fall short of things which are pure 'money'. 
		**Poor Economic Signal**
			Energy has a real cost and therefore Proof of Work, as well as the difficulty adjustement have a useful metric for transforming digital information into value that is measured outside of the system. Taking this expense out of the system, the whole thing becomes a much more speculative calculation of the cost of believing something has value. Bitcoin could be argued to represent the total value of the energy expended to secure itself. A signaling mechanism which is exclusively about that value.
		**Timechain Bloat**
			Adding more information to the base ledger leads to bloat. Ethereum is already at capacity, and fees are extremely high. High fees however, are good for security. Low fees can be achieved by sacrificing the security of the system and centralizing decision making and computer processing. The more secure and decentralized a protocol, the more its value proposition suffers. Because it is no longer trying to be a ledger, removing the Proof of Work consensus protocol makes sense in order to replace it with something that 
		In the end, the question is whether, given that AWS is better than crypto [in every respect](https://medium.com/coinmonks/how-inefficient-are-dapps-c18062c80a71), can 'crypto' provide the guarantee that it is promising. Can it really say that it is tamper proof, open, and decentralized? If not, it is highly unlikely that it will remain.
	**Crypto is not Finance**
		Because of the arguments above (crypto is not money or decentralized), crypto tries to bootstrap the value of the underlying network via 'utility' instead of security.
			This is especially true for non ethereum based L1s like Solana
		One utility ussed to decrease the velocity of the base tokens is Yield Farming, or getting yield by holding a token, issued in the token itself.
