    - [[Guy Kawasaki]] on 10 mistakes of entrepreneurs
        - List
            1. Thinking that getting 1% of a market (car market, hamburger market, phone app market) is easy. It is not easy, so don't think like that.
            2. Scaling too fast. 
                - You anticipate huge growth and customers that will love your product and you invest so much and then it turns out no one wants to buy your product, and you run out of money.
            3. Partnering
                - Partnering is what you do when you are not doing sales
                - Partnering is essentially two companies coming together in an attempt to band-aid their weaknesses. Focus on SALES. Sales fix everything.
            4. Focusing on pitch over prototyping
                - All things for a tech startup is free or cheap. 
                    - Server space, marketing, etc
                - Investors are expecting you to show up with a prototype
                    - Reduce the risk of whether you can deliver a prototype by delivering a prototype
            5. Using too many slides and a small font
                - [[Pitching]]
                    - 10 slides max, 2 minutes per slides, 20 minute talk
                    - 30 pt font. 
                    - Don't read the text, people can read ahead
            6. Doing things serially
                - First raise money, build team, write software, ship, collect
                - it's actually a mess
                    - Do everything at the same time
                    - entrepreneurship is a parallel process
            7. Believing 51% equals control
                - The moment you take outside money you loose control of the company
                - Outside money == moral, ethical, financial obligation  to that money
            8. Believing Patents equals defensibility
                - Patents don't help except for acquisition
                - If microsoft steps over your patent, do you want to litigate it
                    - If a little company wins, this is not a business model
            9. Hiring in your own image
                - Balance out your own prowess
                - Engineer should hire sales, sales should hire engineers.
                - Someone to make it, someone to sell it, someone to collect it
            10. Befriending your VCs
                - They are just here to make money. Meet your deadlines/projections of 80% confidence minimum. Don't think that they're out there to help you and babysit your company.
                - They would rather hate you but you make them rich, than liking a broke guy
                - If your realistic projections are too boring for VCs, then reconsider whether VCs are a right fit
                    - They are looking for the next google, they will settle for a 100 million exit, but not be thrilled
        - Q&A
            - About the Lean Startup
                - Too much money is worse than too little money
                    - When you have too much money your focus is on the wrong things, luxuries, showing off, hiring the wrong people...
                - Y Combinator is good because it gives you little money.

            - Source:: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pKW-ehL7dU)
            - You want to get to this Value Proposition:
                - For **__(target customer)__** who are dissatisfied with **__(the current alternative) __**our product **__(new product)__** that provides **__(key-problem solving capability)__** unlike **__(alternative)__**
                - Fundamental part of starting a business
                - Entrepreneurs tend to start with an idea.
                    - Problem with just an idea:
                        - Free floating, not really specific to make a product
                        - Two Models **Technology -> Platform** vs **Platform -> Technology**
                        - You can have an idea and go looking for a problem
                            - The story is much easier when you start with a problem 
            - Going for the Faster Better Cheaper
                - Not a winning strategy. As a startup, by definition you have less resources. A better funded company can usually beat you in these vectors.
