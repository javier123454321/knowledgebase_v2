- graph theory
    - all models are wrong, but some are useful. One that I believe is actually providing a lot of utility in terms of a way of looking at the world is [[graph theory]] Network science. In these, the primary value and the ontological status off nodes in the network are defined by their relationship to other nodes. This is useful because in reality we are much more than the distinct object that we sometimes identified with. For example we are all a network of cultural programs that we have had imprinted on our brains since we are little. We are also a node in the network that graphs all of the human relationships that we've developed over our lifetime. Finding the degree connectivity {{[[∆]]:6+2}} or the closeness centrality {{[[∆]]:11+2}} of ourselves in our networks provides an opportunity to combine different networks together and achieve something novel. 
    - Who you are is not as important as the graph of who you have connected with, what ideas have transformed you, who respects you, who you have touched, and what you know combined with how you are connecting new experiences, knowledge and relationships to that graph.
