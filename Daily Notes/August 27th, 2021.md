    - [[Rollups]] [[Ethereum]]
        - **Rollups move computation (and state storage) off-chain, but keep some data per transaction on-chain**
        - How it works
            - You have a merkle state tree, and you store a hash of the current state root R0. 
            - Anyone publishes a batch of transactions R1 along with the previous state root R0
                - the contract ensures that R0 === R0,  then the stored hash in the contract moves to R1
                - Now how to prove that the hash is legitimate
                    - Optimistic and Zero Knowledge rollups
                        - Optimistic rollups rely on someone challenging a validator that procesed a malicious transaction. Once a transaction is posted, it is assumed benevolent until challenged, it gets rolled up, then posted after x amount of time.
