Wrote a grant to their grants program:
**
Scope:
	I want to make a series on decentralized finance for my followers. This will break down the following topics:  
		- what is a decentralized exchange,  
		- what is an automated market maker,  
		- how bonding curves work,  
		- yield farming,  
		- liquidity providing,  
		- concentrated liquidity and capital efficiency,  
		- impermanent loss,  
		- I also want to make a video about my experience working with the Uniswap ecosystem.  
	These 9 videos will be anywhere from 60 to 180 seconds, to make for digestible bites.  
	They will also be hosted on different places, though my audience mostly concentrates on TikTok.
	
TikTok is very difficult to predict. I consistently get around 1k views in my videos, but some go viral, which makes calculating the average quite difficult. A problem with the platform is that effort does not always map 1 to 1 with reward.

Total Money Requested: $6,000  
  
This gives me a budget of ~ $666 per video. This would allow me to dedicate more time per video, as well as even outsourcing part of the graphic design animation process.

There are three success outcomes.  
- Onboard people into DeFi, demystifying some of the terminology  
- Explain the basic concepts of AMMs, LPs, Yield Farming, etc.  
- Teach people how to use UniSwap specifically to become more familiar with DeFi
