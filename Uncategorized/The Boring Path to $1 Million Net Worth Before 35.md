            The consulting trap:
                You get much higher than you are worth at a young age, you get much less than you are worth as you gain experience
        Specialize in 3 verticals
        - Networking
            - If your linkedin feed gives you better job listings than your network 7 years in, you are doing something wrong
        - Investing
        - Take a job under these conditions:
            - You can leverage the skills to grow your career or business
            - You can do it in addition to your business
            - Consider career options that provide revenue participation and equity early on
        - Build a venture or side venture
            - Determine the customer - masses or one percent
        - Fitness
            - This is a long game, invest in your tool (your body)
