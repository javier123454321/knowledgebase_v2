            - Be super picky about who you bring into your startup.
            - An easy trap to fall in is saying who can validate that this idea is worth working on. It should be someone that you can trust.
        - [[employees]]
            - Go through the process of asking for the reference
            - Focus on getting the process right, otherwise it can lead to succumbing to the pressure of hiring just to fill that role.
            - Never try to make it work with an employee. Cut the tie as soon as possible. Better to give a large enough severance to make it guilt free.
                - If there is any doubt with a person, there is no doubt.
                - I can't imagine not having this person. That's the aim of a new hire.
        - Stay small as far as you can. 
            - Money exacerbates what you have. If you have a problem, you''ll have more. If you have a solution, it exacerbates the solutions
            - Startups are not milestone based as a lot of things you do before you start working on them
