    - Abstract::
        - Get started, make videos consistently regardless of quality and the process will refine itself as the volume increases. 
    - Summary::
        - No one cares, you can make videos and people won't think about you. Don't fall into the trap that people think about you, [[the spotlight effect]]
        - Gear is not important at the beggining. If anything get audio gear first
        - Quality over quantity
            - At least 150 videos before starting to really strategize content
        - Stack the deck
            - if youtube is a hobby don't worry too much right now
            - If youtube is a business, you can put in the time ahead of time. Focus on editing, building skills or outsource.
        - Use your unfair advantages
            - Success = work x luck x unfair advantage
            - Putting in work makes luck more likely to happen
            - What are the qualities I have and things people want
        - Focus on quantity instead of quality
            - Unless your goal is to make extremely crafted videos.
            - the parable of the ceramics class, every day group a must make a pot, broup b only needs to make 1 pot in 30 days. Group A beats group B all the time
        - Don't worry about your niche yet
            - Niche will develop, and naturally grow over time
            - Just make videos you enjoy
        - Patience and consistency
            - At least 1 video a week
            - It becomes a compounding returns curve
            - Getting the flywheel to turn.

            - No one cares, you can make videos and people won't think about you. Don't fall into the trap that people think about you, [[the spotlight effect]]
                - The spotlight effect is the idea that people think about you much more than they do. Everyone actually is central to their own story, and you are at best a secondary character, more likely an extra.
