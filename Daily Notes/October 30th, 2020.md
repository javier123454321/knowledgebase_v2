            - The implications of the internet seemed to have been understood from its early inception, but what is interesting is his take on its role for revealing the fragmentation in society.
                - [[The epistemological consequence of the internet has simply been to reveal how little a factual observation of the world has to do with arriving at truth.]]
                    - Likewise the coronavirus has augmented this fragmentation. If we actually take the idea that access to information should improve our ability to make a more precise and objective observation of the world, why is it that when we have the most access to this information, what is surfacing is conflicting interpretations of reality
        - Thought on leaving Memory Captures
            - I don't love it anymore, I never really did
                - I see the amount of work that it would take to take a hands off approach
            - Don't get into a business to make money, unless you really want to get money at all costs regardless of what you do
                - Get into running a business if you want to run a business.
            - I was not passionate about the product. 
                - I felt ok about it but not great
            - What do I want to spend my time on?

            - I think it is a great tool for reframing how we approach a problem which we previously had a tunnel vision for. 
            - As a designer, this is an amazing tool and case study in rethinking the approach to something

        - Francis Miller on Organizing Knowledge [[interviewee]] [[Generalized Specialized]]
            - https://www.francismiller.com/organising_knowledge_paper.pdf
            - Knowledge stems from a structure that has to be communicated, usually this is done through text.
                - Knowledge is also structured in a hierarchal manner
                    - Going deep into a subject is a necessity to explain most subjects
                    - {{[[drawing]]}}
            - Modes of organizing knowledge
                - Knowledge maps
                    - Point to gaps, show the whole in one
                        - Do not allow for expanding knowledge in a single area
                - Frederick Reif
                    - Geographical Maps
                        - Fractally reveal themselves as the level of detail increases
                    - How to present complex data
                        - Go from big picture to subsidiary knowledge
                        - Whole to constituent parts
                        - General to specific
                        - To describe universe in terms of experience is necessary because the universe is the largest totality that we can arrive at, which includes all of the synergetic behaviors of the parts.
                            - Starting with the largest synergetic system that we can discover is important because the whole is always more than the sum. If you begin by breaking the whole into part and start from something less than the whole, then you necessarily cannot build up to the entire picture.

                - Google Maps
                    - Can zoom in an out to progressively reveal information
                    - Summary maps need to be distinct, and provided at each step
            - Multi level content
                - Provides another distinction, relation between the constituents parts (and the different levels) goes from 2d to 3d

            - Questions to ask yourself about a new product
                - Am I going to be excited about this in the future
                - Will I be excited telling people about this
                - Do I understand the people that will be using it
                - Do I like the people that will be using it
                - Do I know where to find these people
                - Questions that I have written:
                    - I will talk to the people that will use, pay for the thing that I am looking to do before putting in more than 2 weeks of work.
                    - Am I currently able to do the thing, or learn quickly enough to do the thing?
                    - Do I see myself happily working on this problem for the next 10 years
                        - A huge issue that I see with Memory Captures, is that I am simply uninterested in the problem we are solving. I do not necessarily want to be a leader in this space
                        - If not, does the thing have a deadline after which the work to maintain the thing drops off 10x OR will it give me the leverage
            - People come up with a product idea instead of a business idea
                - Business is a product, but also a pricing model, distribution, marketing, etc.
            - Emailed hundreds of people and get a dozen interviews
            - Show the thing to a hundred people
                - Get feedback incrementally, validate with at least a dozen people
            - Simple lovable product - as opposed to minimum viable product
                - Interviews -> email list -> forums -> communities
        - https://fizzle.co/sparkline/generalist
            - You have to put in the work that it takes to become a specialist, not just drop the ball whenever something gets boring
                - Being a generalist sounds more appealing, because the first 20 hours are the easiest and most exciting to learn
    - [[Literature Notes]]
        - Courtland Allen and Indie Hackers is really systematizing my approach to thinking about problem solving in a way that is economically viable. Business startups are simply people that are trying to tap into a market trend and do the work to ride that. It definitely takes a lot of work, perseverence and determination to get to the point where you have a successful venture, but the steps to get there are not necessarily cryptic or hidden. 
            - Validating your idea comes first. Without this step, it can be an extremely tedious process that turns out to be a total lack of time. The opportunity costs of not taking this step must be considered.
