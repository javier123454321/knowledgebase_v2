Abstract:
Summary:
	Economics already studies 'Mechanism Design' a branch which concerns itself with aligning the incentives of people with a system to have them create some decisions.
	Formally, a mechanism includes a finite set of **players** and a set of potential **social decisions**.
	> _The central task in mechanism design is to_ _specify a mechanism that incentivizes rational agents to behave in certain ways, based upon their private information, that lead to socially desired outcomes_.
	The thing you are trying to get players to do is measured by an **objective function**.
