Day 6 of polyphasic sleep experiment - meditation lecture with friends from out of town is today ao getting out by 11 will likely cause slight social discomfort. Will probably be fine, hoped to meditate in the morning but did not achieve it. 

Sleep Cycle
	**Core - 11:00 pm to 1:50** slept some pretty nice cycles according to the app. Felt awake right away, but didn't get a chance to do much productive work. Was in a meeting. At aroudn 5:30 I got super tired and dissuaded myself from meditating as I would fall asleep. Will hopefully meditate after the nap. 
	**N1 - 6:58 - 7:20** This was a restful nap. I dreamt, woke up and dreamt again in 22 minutes. Woke right up after and got up. 
	**N2 - 12:00 - 12:20** Slept really well, woke up really rested
	**N3 - 5:40 - 6:00 pm** Also slept really well, getting better at falling asleep right away
