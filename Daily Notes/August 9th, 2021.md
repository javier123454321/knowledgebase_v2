        - Startups are counterintuitive. Advice won't make sense by definition.
            - Getting startup advice is often ignored for this reason
        - Knowledge about startups does not matter, what matters is knowledge about customer problems.
            - If you have a solution, it doesn't matter that the details are not perfect
            - Knowing startups can lead to a person going through the motions. This works in school, and is the curse of overachievers, because they have been given a path to get where they are and doing it excellently.
                - (the traditional thing, that you can almost game is getting funded)
        - Looking for the trick, gaming the system, does not work in startups.
            -  There is no boss to trick, only users.
        - Startups will consume your life, and successful startups will take your life for a long time.
            - People don't see the dificulty of starting a startup, successful founders don't get sympathy.
                - The difficulties of startup life are somewhat concealed for this reason.

        - Investors need to be educated
            - They are really looking at how you are educating them on the space which you are building
        - How fast are you moving. Have you launched an mvp, and what have you learned from it
        - Having clarity of thought around your idea is key. The CEO is the spokesperson for the idea, and it needs to be clear.
            - You need clarity as to be able to recruit other people that will also not be willing to help you otherwise. 
        - Raising money adds people problems above all the other problems
            - Solve other problems.
            - Find out how much money you need to reach your next milestone and don't go after a penny more
            - The less data you have the larger your dillution. Have some level of traction.
                - If you cannot get the data, make relevant data. Focus on getting the first 100 users.
            - The goal of running the company is not to find investors. You find investors for one specific outcome.
        - The best reference is from an investor's portfolio of founders
