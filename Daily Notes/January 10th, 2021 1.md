        - So much of the best human capital is locked up on the 5 largest coorporations creating advertising platforms
            - Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon, Netflix
    - What is effective learning
        - https://app.edyoucated.org/learn/tracks/02a12392-68fc-447c-b4b5-7826e7ae8db7 We think we learn, but we don't learn effectively
        - Three obstacles to learning
            - People learn the wrong things
                - I don't know what to learn or where to start
            - People Don't really learn
                - Or you stop before you actually learn something
                - You want to learn something new but starting is the most difficult task
                - I have no time to learn, I get distracted, I procrastinate
            - People learn ineffectively
                - There is no retention
                - looking over material does not mean you can recall it. 
        - Solutions
            - **Deconstruction** the solution to People learn the wrong things
                - Find the skills that are transferable between skills
                - Short term: Know which skills have the most value (Drawing a map)
                - Long Term: Learn which skills and techniques are transferable to other learning goals (Drawing a map effectively)
            - Preventing Procastrination
                - Reducing friction to start (Commit to 10 minutes rather than 10 hours to learn)
                - Align your environment to your goal (Put the material close to where you will see it)
                - Prepare a schedule in advance
                - Two minute rule
                    - Instead of a big commitment, commit to a task that is only two minutes to do. 
                - External commitment
                - Minimize Distractions:
                    - switch off your phone
                    - Increase focus associated with learning
                - Building Habits
                    - Habits are low friction ways to do something
                        - Start small (1 page instead of a chapter)
                        - If then habit. tack on a habit to another existing habit. Everytime you get cofee, read the news.
            - Learning Effectively
                - Physical basics, optimize physical and mental health
                    - Sleep, nutrition, meditation
                - Repetition
                - Applied Learning
                    - Learn by doing [[Experience and Education]]
                - Integrating feedback loops
                    - Use Active Recall
                        - Is the understanding superficial? What is the most important part of the material that you consumed?
                - Finding the Bottleneck
                    - Focus on the areas that you are not as good as.
                - Teaching Others
                    - Feynman Technique
                        - 1 Choose a topic
                        - 2 Teach it to a less experienced person
                        - 3 Identify gaps in your explanation
                        - 4 Review and simplify
                        - 5 Go back to step 2
