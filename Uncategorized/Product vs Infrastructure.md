            - Product vs Infrastructure Engineers

                - You can be product focused and work on the backend, this is fine. Being product focused and working on the infrastructure, it becomes dreadful
                    - This maps 1 to 1 to my relationship with QA role at Celltrak. I really disliked it because it was just too far removed from the personal. I kept talking about it as a creativity block, but I was coding infrastucture, which required creativity, but was too divorced from product.
