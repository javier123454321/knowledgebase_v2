        - The Stockdale Paradox [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLicgt04hHY)
            - You must never confuse faith that you will prevail at the end-- which you can never afford to lose -- with the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality, whatever they may be.
                - The optimists end up dying
            - You need to know you will prevail in the end - a goal that is so ambitious that it will motivate you to be a 10 year overnight success
                - Startups are callings
                - The 10 year overnight success
                - Knowing you will prevail but having a plan that is reevaluated as the data comes in. 
            - Just because the full consequences havent hit yet, doesn't mean that there is no problem - Charlie Munger
                - You need to acknowledge the problems - don't lie to yourself, then the problems become unknown unknowns.
                - You need an extreme devotion to the truth, if you can't have that conversation with your management, then ypu have no management
            - To start a company you need to study reality carefully, then you need to bend it.
