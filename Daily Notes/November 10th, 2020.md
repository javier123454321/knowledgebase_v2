            - Sometimes systems are defined by their constituent parts
            - In networks, the connections between the nodes become more and more descriptive of the system rather than the nodes themselves
            - The system is defined by its connectivity
                - The space of connectivity is not euclidean
                    - It has its own network topology (creates its own geometry)
                        - The space of connectivity does not relate to the space of objects in a vacuum
                - London is closer to Istanbul than Hungary if you think of the connectivity of  the nodes in the air travel network
                - 
            - Networks are emergent
                - Ants leave a trail of scents creating networks
                    - It is an interaction of the items within the networks and the context
            - interactions between nodes in the network can grow exponentially
            - Network theory overview
                - [[graph theory]]
                    - Mathematics to describe the network
                    - Networks are consisted of at least one vertex (node) and an edge
                        - vertices are things that are quantifiable
                        - Edges are a relation between two nodes (tangible like roads and cables) or intangible like relationships or trust
                            - Generalized principles, are actually eternal, the relationships are the potential for interactions not the finite interactions themselves
                                - Edges in graph theory are far more concrete than the principles that Buckminster Fuller talks about, although there is a case for giving this relationship a primary ontological status.
                            - Nodes that belong to an edge are endpoints
                    - A graph is a relationship with nodes and edges
                        - Directed graphs have directions
                            - Have order to the relations
                        - Undirected graphs have no direction
                            - Edges are interchangeable for each node
                                - Bob is married to Jane, Jane is married to bob == Jane and Bob are married
                        - weighted graphs have a volume in the edges
                        - Multiplex graphs are interconnected between two or more graphs
                - Begin by defining the network
                    - [[all models are wrong but some are useful]]
                        - We need to disseminate out of the totality of information, which areas will we want to put our focus on and which will be neglected
                - How connected is a node and how central it is to the overall network
                - The dynamics of the global network affects the individual constituent parts.
                    - Distribution Density, Connectivity Clustering are features of the nodes and of the overall network
            - Most networks aren't random, they are defined by the rules that the nodes play in the system
                - However, most networks are not designed like a computer network
            - Network Diffussion
                - How fast something can spread through a network.
                - Sometimes high degree of diffusion (viral content) is desired, and sometimes low is (actual viruses)
            - Node Connectivity
                - Instead of giving primacy to the properties of a thing, we give connectivity higher value
                - Degree is the measure in the number of connections it has in a node. 
                - Can be in and Out degree
                    - The number of importing relationships is the In degree
                        - Twitter following
                    - the out is the number of export relations
                        - Twitter Followers
                    - it can also be described mathematically by the weight of the edge (if it is a weighted graph)
                        - The trust that followers have on me, that I have on them
            - A graph looks like a matrix in a computer
                - A walk is a sequence of adjacent vertices that do not visit the same node twice, and a geodesic is the shortest walk that two nodes must take to reach each other
            - Centrality tells us the measure of signigificance in a node in a network [*](((kQz3nVmVR))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
                - Significance varies, centrality defines what makes a node important
                    - Connectivity is degree of the node vs max degree - dependent on the context
                    - Quantity of Flow and Importance
                    - ### Centrality Metrics
                        - degree connectivity[*](((Cb7gHEuNE))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
                            - Primary metric that defines the significance of a node based on degree
                        - closeness centrality[*](((0Wt11F57-))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
                            - How close a node is to another node on the network. how is it to reach others
                                - How long it will take to communicate with all the other nodes.
                        - betweeness[*](((uBSOkTF1H))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
                            - The node's role as a bridge or connector
                            - How critical a node is to the functioning to a network, how often is a node a bridge to the shortest path between two networks.
                        - prestige centrality[*](((1xBvoXNYf))) {{[[r/moved]]}}
                            - How significant you are based on proximity to other nodes in the network
                            - How connected the nodes are that connect to this node.
                                - value vs quantity of connections
                                - Eigenvector centrality
                                    - Assigns relative scores to all nodes based on the concept that connections to highly connected nodes are more valuable than to sparcely connected nodes.

        - Network Topology
            - Networks start randomly organized, but develop an overall structure over time
            - Topolgy describes the overall patterns of the way that things are connected.

                - Given the relationships, many things have to be considered.
                - A star network takes 2 hops to reach any node vs three in ring or 4 in line
                - Connectivity
                    - the density of networks within the system
                        - How easy it is to connect two nodes
                - Scale
                    - small communities vs large cities
                - Clustering 
                    - How things that are close relate to each other.
            - Networks are created by nodes in the system, but are later on defined by this relationships
    - [[Mattereum White Paper]]
        - A large portion of assets that exist in the world are currently not in a marketplace for the friction in arriving at information about them. Think of all the pieces that a house has, all the objects that exist there and are underutilized, if there was a clear and low friction way of creating a marketplace for those products, they might be mobilized into an economy that exists now but is not being served.
        - Mattereum is looking to create a smart property register that unlocks $10,000,000,000 in assets in the third world
            - opacity and friction in the process is a real problem that gets smoothed out as information rises to the surface
        - Utilities vs Security tokens
            - When linked to physical assets so much of the
