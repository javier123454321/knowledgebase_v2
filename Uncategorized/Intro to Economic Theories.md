Abstract:
Summary:
	**Lesson 1:**
		The course will go over 4 economic theories. It will lack depth into mathematic tools and economic models. It will lookk at the interaction between the 3 economic domains.
		[[Markets]]
			Firms exchanging goods and services, and towards consumers. Compete with each other for consumer demand.
			Create Private Value
		[[State]]
			Rules are created by political forces and enforced by state agencies. Preventing the abuse of power by big firms.
			Create Public Value
		[[Communities]]
			Individuals and social groups. Labor unions, social groups like greenpeace, etc
			Create Social Value
		The Pluralist approach will show what different interactions do different approaches afford.
	**Lesson 2:**
		Markets are not value free, neither are politics or communities. 
		Economics have values also, efficiency is a value. Broad and Narrow efficiency for example. Broad efficiency includes negative externalities in the calculation.
		The four types of economics:
			[[Social Economics]]
				Embeddedness = the economy is part of society
				Recognition of the community economy with its unpaid work
				recognition that economic agents have a variety of motives and are not always self centered.
			[[Institutional economics]]
				Institutioons aare formal - with codified rules, regulations, and organizations. Informal instittutions have unwritten rules, beliegs and rules of thumb. 
				Assymetric institutions have different effects on different groups.
			[[Post Keynesian Economics]]
				 looks more at economy as a whole than at the individual level. 
				 [[Aggregate Demand]] is the total demand of all households, firms, governments and the rest of the world.  Low AD results in pessimism, consumers don't buy, investors don't invest.
				 [[Market Power]] is the take that firms have the power to reduce competition, rendering the free market with full competition as unapplicable.
				 [[Uncertainty]] as opposed to risk. Risk is accountable and can be factored in, whereas uncertainty cannot be.
			[[Neoclassical economics]]
				Abstractly assumes an ideal market without market power. Only risk and not uncertainty, and perfectly rational agents who act in their self interest.
				Focused on mathematical modelling and theorization.
				The law of diminishing marginal utility. Each additional piece has less relative utility.
	**Lesson 3** - [[Individual Households]]
		Household's economic activities:
			1. Reproduction = unpaid caring for the current and future generation of labour and for others
			2. Joint production through division of labour - specialization of different household members in different skills and paid or unpaid work
			3. Joint consumption
				Economies of Scale
				Economies of Scope
			4. Income Pooling
			5. Risk Pooling
		Cooperation and conflict in households
			Gender is the socially and culturally constructed differences between men and women 'femeninity and masculinity'
		Gender division of labour
		   Men do more paid work and women more unpaid work on average in societies.	
		Household Bargaining Concepts
			Sources of bargaining power
				- Resources
				- Skills
				- Opportunities
			Threat point of bargaining
				Exit situation for each partner - the point in which one party leaves the agreement (credible threat)
		[Social Economics](Social%20Economics) and [Institutional economics](Institutional%20economics)
			The cost of and wellbeing of the family based on traditional gender norms is greater than in equal gender norms.
		[Neoclassical economics](Neoclassical%20economics)
			Short term analysis - ignore institutional or social constraints to substitute between the production of market goods and home goods - assume full substitutability
			Opportunity cost as a method: time = money
			How much does each member of the household give up to do household work?
				The question that is concerning here, is how to maximize the potential gain in time. If the man was to earn more, the opportunity cost of not working is greater for him than for her.
	**Lesson 4** - Consumption
		Individuals consume consumer goods which can be final, intermediate, durable, or can be services..
		The state consumes public goods and community services.
		**Social Economics Theory of Consumption**
			There is no consumer sovereignty, advertising, social norms, standards, credit, temptations.
				[[Normal Goods]]:
					Buy more when you have more income - a car
				Inferior Goods:
					Buy less as you have more income - public transport
				Giffen Good
					People buy less as its price decreases - staple food like rice, you buy less to get more healthy food
			Consumerism => Veblen effect
				Goods people will buy even if you can get the same for cheaper
					Information opaqueness about quality
					Status
		**Post Keynesian theory of consumption**
			There is a different consumer pattern with people with different incomes.
			As you become richer, you save more proportionally and spend less.
		**Neoclassical Theory**
			Based on normal goods
			![](Pasted%20image%2020220627155150.png)
			Consumers D2 and D3 have more money available to buy consumer goods.
			Can calculate the price elasticity of demand.
				As a supplier of goods, you want to learn if you will lose money. High elasticity means that people wil buy less in the case of higher prices.
				$$E=\Delta D\Delta P$$
				E is negative for normal goods, inelastic for 0<E<1 and elastic for E>1
				Cross elasticity of Demand has a substitution effect from one good to another.
				A substitution effect, the price change of X affects demand for Y
				The income effect affect the behavior of buying X and Y
				Marginal Decay in Utility
					Each subsequent consumption has less utility than the first one..
