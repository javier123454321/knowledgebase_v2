- Abstract::
    - If you want to have a token which grows in value, you need to incentivize people to hold it long term. 
- Summary::
    - > Basically, all token pitches include a line that goes something like this: “There is a fixed supply of tokens. As demand for the token increases, so must the price.”
    - Blockchains could stop ticket fraud. Also make resale less profitable, etc
        -  Aventus, Ticketchain or Blocktix all target this token, but if you have to convert dollars to their coin there is no reason that things will appreciate in value.
        - Venues also don't want to hold the blockchain currency that their ticket is arbitrarily denominated in. 
        - > The presence of a proprietary token actually creates a worse UX for consumers by introducing an unnecessary layer of friction into the ticket purchasing process
        - Even if demand for the network skyrockets, the demand for the token won't reflect that demand.
            - __Average Network Value = Total Transaction Volume / Velocity__
    - You want to reduce the velocity
        - Augur has a profit share mechanism
            - > ($REP) network pays REP holders for performing work for the network. REP tokens are like taxi medallions: you must pay for the right to work for the network. Specifically, REP holders must report event outcomes to resolve prediction markets.
        - Staking into the network
            - Reward users for holding the token
        - ____ Balanced burn-and-mint mechanics____
            - How do you distribute the inflation?
        - Gamification:
            - If tickets are meant to sell out, you can reward token holders that have held for longer
        -  Become a store of value
    - > Velocity is one of the key levers that will influence long-term, non-speculative value.

Most utility tokens don’t provide a compelling reason for token holders to hold the token for more than a few seconds. Absent speculation, assets with high velocity will struggle to maintain long-term price appreciation.

Hence, protocol designers will be well served to incorporate mechanisms into their protocols that encourage holding, not just usage.

            - You want to reduce the velocity
                - The article does not mention timelocking, which is another way to ensure that velocity is slower. (basically adding a vesting period)
